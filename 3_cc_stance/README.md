`1_MTurk` contains the annotations (`full_annotations.tsv`) and anonymized subject demographic info (`anon_subj_info.tsv`) that we obtain from 5 rounds of data collection through Amazon Mechanical Turk. 

`2_Stance_model` contains scripts for training the weighted BERT classifier and modeling the annotated data, as well as the predictions of our best performing model on extracted Opinion clauses.
