Sometimes I struggled with determining if a statement supported the target statement or if it was neutral. I think it was harder since it was isolated statements without context.

Wed Nov 20 2019 13:14:19 GMT-0600 (Central Standard Time)	1574277259410	I honestly think I did poorly on this task. I kept confusing neutral and supporting statements.	I could pick out false statements just fine, but I had trouble picking apart supporting statements from neutral. So many of the statements that sound neutral could be placed in the supporting category because people use them to support global warming. This led me to be super confused at points. Providing more examples might help.	404	1	31	female	graduated_high_school	independent	TX	1574277935259	11.26415	indeed	extremely	equal	yes	extremely	month	not	2	1
