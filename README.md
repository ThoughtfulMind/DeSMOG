# Climate change stance classifier

TODOs

- [ ] Training and test data
   - [ ] SemEval 2016 task 6 train, trial--both very small (211 for, 15 against)
   - [ ] SemEval 2016 test (subtask A)--169 tweets (123 for, 11 against, 35 none)
   - [ ] Mohammad et al. paper--data requested
   - [ ] Dallas' annotated news data
   - [ ] Yiwei's news data--needs annotation
- [ ] MTurk (or other)
   - [ ] pilot, iterate with smaller subsample to check inter-annotator agreement
   - [ ] subjectivity can play a big role depending on annotator's own background
