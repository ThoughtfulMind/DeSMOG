       "1  In June 1982 , up to a million demonstrators gathered in Central Park calling for a nuclear freeze .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2  They were protesting the Reagan-era nuclear arms buildup and other developments they saw , not unreasonably , as a threat to civilization and to life on Earth , including talk by some Reagan aides about fighting and winning a nuclear war .                                                                                                                                                         \n",
