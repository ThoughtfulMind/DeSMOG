The most effective antibody transfer occurs in colostrum as this has the highest concentration of antibodies \"_CITATION_PREVIOUS_POST_\" Has considerably lower levels of antibodies. The infant gut is \\'leakiest\\' to accepting antibodies in the first 3 days this rapidly falls after this so very few antibodies are absorbed. Good science has shown that maternally derived antibodies drop away rapidly at 8 weeks after birth hence the timing of the initial vaccination schedules. The rise in chronic illness in particular immune mediated illnesses like asthma and eczema are widely attributed to the \"clean theory\". Vaccine science is considerably more advanced in the veterinary world and we have much larger better quality studies looking at titres comparing natural and vaccine related immunity and maternally derived antibodies. Plus we have the first \\'canary pox technology\\' vaccine in the world which has good protection and much, much lower vaccine reactions than traditional technology. So it is really worth reading veterinary papers as well as human ones.']"

[SEP] The report, which cites thousands of peer-reviewed articles the United Nations-sponsored panel on climate change ignored, also found that “no empirical evidence exists to substantiate the claim that 2°C of warming presents a threat to planetary ecologies or environments” and no convincing case can be made that “a warming will be more economically costly than an equivalent cooling.” The U.N.’s panel is scheduled to release its next report next month.\n",
