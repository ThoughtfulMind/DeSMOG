Indeed, there is major evidence that human effects may be too small to mandate action, and that's the key question.	2
But the rule would have effectively killed any new coal-fired plants, because they emit nearly twice as much carbon per unit of electricity as natural gas plants and there is currently no available technology to bring their emissions under the limit.	2
One delegate from a major developing country , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks , said there was no longer time for open-ended discussions.	2

Credits or penalties would be assessed according to both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with each of the steps in the fuel's life cycle, including production, transport and tailpipe emissions.	2
But the justices also wondered whether it would make much difference in the long run.	2
Scientists generally agree that it has been getting warmer over the last hundred years, but the average rate of change is no greater than in centuries past, and there is no consensus that human activity is the cause.	2
Instead of regulating plant by plant, the proposal sets emissions goals for the states and provides flexibility on how to meet them.	2
That 's because there is no objective basis for the charge.	2
The policy shift, if it holds up, is substantial.	2
The six nations, the United States, Japan, Australia, China, India and South Korea, will build on existing bilateral agreements on technology sharing to control emissions, but will not set mandatory targets.	2
