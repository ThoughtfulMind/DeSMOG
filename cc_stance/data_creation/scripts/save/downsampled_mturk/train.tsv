The rise in global average temperatures stopped in the late 1990s.	2
When the media the media speak of unusually hot weather as a sign of global warming, the media never seem to look for places where it is unusually cold to show natures balance.	2
No region of our country is immune to that threat, even though climate alarmist prediction models have consistently failed and even though the relationship between the burning of fossil fuels and global warming or cooling is far from well understood.	2
Alarmists about global warming are trying to gain more power over the economy and our lives.	2
Global warming has stalled.	2
USCRN temperature stations show no warming since 2005 when the network went online.	2
The global warming crowd cant get any crazier.	2
Then theres the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields.	2
But only half of the carbon dioxide stays up there.	2
New laws are needed to crack down on climate activists and progressives who want to tell you where to live.	2
If the Keystone XL pipeline, which American environmentalists oppose, is not built, the oil would still be extracted at the same rate but would be shipped by rail, so building the pipeline would not increase carbon emissions significantly.	2
There is no solid evidence of global warming.	2
Global temperatures today are the same as they are 115,000 years ago, a time when modern humans were only just beginning to leave Africa.	2
Earth is about to go through an extensive global cooling period.	2
While the planet is in the midst of a warming trend of several hundred years, the Earth has not warmed at all since she was born.	2
Man-made global warming may further lessen the likelihood of the freak atmospheric steering currents that last year shoved Superstorm Sandy due west into New Jersey.	2
This is about economic migration and about political instability, not about global warming.	2
There is a rush to judgment that every time something happens its because of global warming.	2
