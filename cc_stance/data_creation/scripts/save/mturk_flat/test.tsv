Global warming isn’t happening.	2
By now there should have been global warming equivalent to 2.8 degrees / century.	2
Scientists had manipulated data to hide the decline in global temperatures.	2
The scientists responsible for bigging up global warming are a bunch of useless, lying, cheating, conniving, scum-sucking bottom feeders who by rights should be in jail rather than anywhere near a lab.	2
One of those pesky realist scientists whose research using awkward facts shows that global warming isn’t nearly the peril it’s cracked up to be and which may ultimately be one of the reasons why Flannery no longer has that $ 180,000 a year (for a three-day week) job.	2
Better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming.	2
Global warming is a myth the greenies’ heads exploded.	2
The benefits of carbon dioxide outweigh the environmental costs.	2
Historically the earth has warmed and cooled through natural weather fluctuation and that the fear mongering regarding global warming / man-made climate change is based on false assumptions, unsustained by science.	2
There has been no global warming for nearly 19 years.	2
Several leading climate scientists’ve got their facts wrong about global warming.	2
The non-climatic effects of carbon dioxide as a sustainer of wildlife and crop plants are enormously beneficial, that the possibly harmful climatic effects of carbon dioxide have been greatly exaggerated, and that the benefits clearly outweigh the possible damage.	2
Global cooling is coming.	2
Glaciers and sea ice may have been melting, but eventually Earth would move into an intense cooling pattern again.	2
The National Oceanic and Atmosphere Association fudged numbers to support the agenda of global warming.	2
A far more likely contender for the cause of the glacier melt is the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation.	2
News about global warming is generally exaggerated.	2
It gives us a dangerous climate that we make safe, above all, by using energy from fossil fuels.	2
Science disagrees with his phony claim that this cold snap has anything to do with Climate Change, Global Warming, or whatever these Truthers are calling it this week.	2
There is no proof that global warming is caused by humans, and no proof that global warming will cause catastrophic issues for Earth.	2
Global warming has been at a plateau since 1990.	2
This a sneaky way to cover up the reality that global warming is a sham.	2
There is next to no scientific evidence anywhere to back up their doomsday predictions of catastrophic man-made global warming.	2
Global warming isn't real Leo.	2
Climate contrarians somehow tend to neglect mentioning that solar variation is smaller than the heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide.	2
Of course, climate change advocates are trying their best to offer an explanation for the lack of global warming.	2
The sea is not rising.	2
Bringing up climate change derails discussions of community-based solutions for problems like flooding and the resulting problems of transportation and public health.	2
Then there’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields.	2
Human impact on the global climate is small.	2
Temperature readings from the Arctic and Antarctic used to estimate the effects of global warming are nothing more than guesswork.	2
All that our world leaders need is a little more common sense, in order to avoid the nonsense of seeking a globally-binding treaty to reduce CO2 emissions.	2
The world will avoid global warming of more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.	2
Global temperature had dropped in the last 10 years.	2
Climate models have failed to accurately predict global temperatures.	2
Devastating allegations that even the tiny amount of global warming the grandees of Parisâve been able to document is based largely on falsified data and manipulated spreadsheets.	2
The number of floods and droughts has not increased because of climate change, and extensive research by geophysicist Dennis Hedke shows sea-level trends are not significantly different from what they are seven to nine decades ago.	2
The global fight against climate change is a threat to the American economy.	2
Mr. Pruitt is preparing to convene a âred teamâ of researchers to challenge the notion, broadly accepted among climate scientists, that carbon dioxide and other emissions from fossil fuels are the primary drivers of climate change.	2
The scientists are wrong when they say global warming is real.	2
The alleged â consensus â behind the dangers of anthropogenic global warming is not nearly as settled among climate scientists as people imagine.	2
If the Keystone XL pipeline, which American environmentalists oppose, is not built, the oil would still be extracted at the same rate but would be shipped by rail, so building the pipeline would not increase carbon emissions significantly.	2
Just how vacuous the global warming narrative has become.	2
The global warming agenda is a loser for them with the American people.	2
Fossil fuels are the moral choice for the developing world.	2
I am also old enough to remember when Climate Change was called Global Warming and then had to be re-branded because God made it snow every time Al Gore gave a speech.	2
Sheâs in the pocket of the fossil fuel industry.	2
Anyone who wants to kill the dangerous and unfounded climate scare should focus on exposing the shaky science behind climate alarm.	2
There is indeed no scientific basis for claims that billions of people are going to die from climate change.	2
It is not the time to talk about climate change, and that those who did are merely trying to score political points.	2
Strengthening Australia's carbon emission reduction targets will damage the economy.	2
Climate change is not a true crisis.	2
Global warming will be small, slow, harmless and net beneficial.	2
There are fewer climate problems elsewhere.	2
What is once considered one of the most remarkable cases of accelerated anthropogenic climate warming is not due to human causes at all but rather to natural climate swings.	2
Climate crisis advocates attempt to dismiss the minor satellite-measured warming by utilizing ground temperature stations around the globe, which tend to have even more corrupting biases and problems than the old U.S. stations.	2
Anthropomorphic climate change is a scam.	2
Our current temperatures are not at all unusual nor unprecedented, but very similar to previous warming trends over the last several thousand years.	2
Australians care about the high cost of environmental activism based on questionable climate alarmism.	2
Spokespersons of the movement claims that billions of people are going to die from climate change have no basis whatsoever in scientific fact but are necessary to provoke the kind of response that is needed to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions.	2
There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent.	2
This is one of the key goals of climate alarmist policy.	2
Climate change is a huge confidence trick.	2
Future warming will be benign, supporting his position with convincing data.	2
Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is in no position to give economic advice until she's gone to college and come out with an economics degree.	2
Lewis recruited over 200 members of APS to oppose the new APS policy that fully supports the global warming fraud.	2
Natural causes explain climate change.	2
While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it.	2
The drought is unrelated to climate change.	2
The climate facade is a late addition.	2
Scaring young people young people into believing that climate change is going to kill young people is child abuse.	2
