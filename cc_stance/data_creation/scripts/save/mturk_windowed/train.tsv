This would still be a major problem, according to climate change adherents. However, a new reckoning of the rising sea levels finds that previous calculations have have been off, and by quite a bit. The actual rise in sea levels measured only 1.2 millimeters instead of the previously accepted 1.6 to 1.9 millimeters. This, the researchers say, means that the actual rise has fallen from the once-imagined 6.7 inches over 90 years to 4.2 inches. A recent New York Times article noted that this means the difference between the old and new numbers “turns out to be an immense amount of water: on the order of two quadrillion gallons.” That would be about as much water as the whole of Lake Superior.	1
Claims of global warming have been greatly exaggerated. In 2012, The Economist called the Heartland Institute “the world’s most prominent think tank promoting skepticism about man-made climate change,” and this conference certainly lived up to that reputation. You can see many of the speeches at the conference website and at Heartland’s Youtube channel.	2
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change should be clearer on how it draws conclusions from the body of research it assesses when gauging the impacts of global warming. Here’s an Associated Press summary in The Times and a BBC article on the Dutch findings, which are in a report initiated after an errant conclusion about the risks from rising sea levels in the Netherlands made it into the 2007 climate assessments by the panel. That particular error, the Dutch agency said, was its own fault.	1
Evidence now leans against global warming resulting from human-related greenhouse gas emissions. The report, which cites thousands of peer-reviewed articles the United Nations-sponsored panel on climate change ignored, also found that “no empirical evidence exists to substantiate the claim that 2°C of warming presents a threat to planetary ecologies or environments” and no convincing case can be made that “a warming will be more economically costly than an equivalent cooling.” The U.N.’s panel is scheduled to release its next report next month. The Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, or NIPCC, which produced the report, is described as “an international panel of scientists and scholars who came together to understand the causes and consequences of climate change.” Unlike the “United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which is government-sponsored, politically motivated, and predisposed to believing that climate change is a problem in need of a U.N. solution,” NIPCC “has no formal attachment to or sponsorship from any government or governmental agency” and is “wholly independent of political pressures and influences and therefore is not predisposed to produce politically motivated conclusions or policy recommendations.” In Climate Change Reconsidered II: Physical Science, which The Heartland Institute published and released on Tuesday, lead authors Craig D. Idso, Robert M. Carter, and S. Fred Singer worked with a team of scientists to produce a 1,200-page report that is “comprehensive, objective, and faithful to the scientific method.” They found that even “if the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide were to double,” whatever “warming may occur would likely be modest and cause no net harm to the global environment or to human well-being.” Breitbart News obtained a detailed summary of the report’s key findings.	2
Ousley-Nevarez visited Europe last fall. She shows me a picture she took of a flood gauge on an old wall in a town near the border of Germany and Austria. Flooding has been going on forever. “It is what it is. You can’t change it.” The Harris County Flood Control District is not so fatalistic.	2
The world is warming not only because fossil fuels are being burned, but also because soils, forests and wetlands are being ravaged. In recent years, some scientists have begun to ask whether we can put some of that carbon back into the soil and into living ecosystems, like grasslands and forests. Simply reducing emissions will not sufficiently limit global warming. According to the 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an authority on climate science that operates under the auspices of the United Nations, humankind also needs to remove some of the carbon already in the atmosphere to avoid, say, the collapse of polar glaciers and the inundation of coastal cities worldwide. “We can’t just reduce emissions,” Keith Paustian, a soil scientist at Colorado State University and an author of an earlier I.P.C.C.	0
“I have to admit,” Spencer said, “adding Co2 to the atmosphere should cause some warming, but I think it’s an entirely open question… how much warming we’re going to get from adding Co2 to the atmosphere.” And this factor “makes all the difference between Al Gore’s Armageddon and ‘who cares it’s probably a beneficial thing. '” Spencer then went on to illustrate how easy it is to make assumptions based on “data” by showing a graph on the screen that showed how the rise in UFO sightings coincided with the rise in ocean temperatures and joked that maybe aliens are causing global warming. Climate deniers blame global warming on aliens from outer space. The UFO joke graph was the first of a series of more serious graphs that Spencer presented to show that much of the alarmist rhetoric over global warming is not supported by facts. For instance, after the humorous graph, Spencer showed one that revealed that nearly every century since Roman times has experienced either global warming or global cooling proving that the “norm” is wild change and not some grand mean leveling.	1
This was a roll-out of a new talk built on notes. I’m writing a series of posts building on this talk, which you’ll see here as I introduce some new directions for Dot Earth starting next month. Global warming is inevitably going to be, at best, managed . As I mentioned in my talk, it’s not hard to find signals that diplomatic and legislative efforts are destined to be inadequate and new approaches are needed. When Friends of the Earth (U.K.) says that some geo-engineering options need to be explored (cloud management and direct air capture of carbon dioxide) you know they’re not counting on emissions pledges.	0
The satellite data is compiled by two separate sets of researchers, whose results match each other closely. One team that compiles the data includes Climate Professors John Christy and Roy Spencer at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, both of whom question Karl’s adjusted data. The study is one more example that you can get any answer you want when the thermometer data errors are larger than the global warming signal you are looking for. “We believe the satellite measurements since 1979 provide a more robust measure of global temperatures, and both satellite research groups see virtually the same pause in global temperatures for the last 18 years,” he said. Karl said satellite data also have issues, including “orbital decay, diurnal sampling, instrument calibration target temperatures and more.” Spencer said he agreed that those are issues, but they are less problematic than using data from thousands of ships and buoys.	2
 FILE - In this Jan. 8, 2018 file photo taken with a drone shows the flooded village of Rees at river Rhine, Monday, Jan. 8, 2018. Millions more people around the world are threatened by river floods in coming decades due to climate change. Researchers in Germany say greater flood defenses are particularly needed in the United States, parts of India and Africa, Indonesia and Central Europe. (Arnulf Stoffel/dpa via AP) BERLIN (AP) — Global warming will increase the risk of river flooding over the coming decades, endangering millions more people around the world, according to a study published Thursday.	0
Scientists are predicting that this world in motion, this world already aflame, is just the prologue. As the effects of global climate change become more pronounced, the number of displaced people will double, then triple, and possibly only continue to grow. Two billion people may be displaced by rising sea levels by the turn of the next century. Coastal peoples will press inland, while farmland off the coasts is likely to be increasingly compromised by drought and desertification. He concludes: “Bottom line: Far more people are going to be living on far less land, and land that is not as fertile and habitable and sustainable as the low-elevation coastal zone…And it’s coming at us faster than we thought.” Madeline and Seamus will be in their eighties (god willing) when Geisler’s predictions come to pass.	0
No: There are still voices ridiculing this conclusion. About the record-breaking intensity of Hurricane Irma, Mr. Trump said that “we’ve had bigger storms than this.” And Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, took righteous exception to discussing the “cause and effect of these storms” as “very, very insensitive to the people in Florida.” Both were engaging in climate rejection rather than denial. Global warming is real and threatening. But there is good reason to believe that climate rejecters, including the president and Mr. Pruitt, are fighting a losing battle. The apocalyptic fear aroused by the recent destructive hurricanes is the latest manifestation of the mounting dread that has taken hold in the American mind-set about the implications of our steadily warming planet.	0
Contrast this with the clear image conveyed by images of an oil spill. In this case, the origins of the spill are clear and unambiguous, the impacts graphic, and the whole environmental incident is easily understood. There is a danger that we can get used to global warming. Individuals 17 or under have grown up in a world where global climate change has always existed as a public concern. (The first climate treaty was negotiated in 1992.)	0
President Trump has said nothing about it. [The New York Times] • More than 40 governments around the world, including California, have put a price on carbon.

Here’s what we learned.	0
A team of scientists from New York University captured a video of a 4-mile iceberg breaking away from a glacier in eastern Greenland. The massive new iceberg, which would stretch from lower Manhattan up to Midtown in New York City, can be instructive to scientists and policy makers who are studying the impact of human actions on global sea-level rise. Global sea-level rise is both undeniable and consequential. “By capturing how it unfolds, we can see, first-hand, its breathtaking significance.” PAYPAL SLAMMED AFTER TELLING CUSTOMER THAT HER DEATH &apos;BREACHED ITS RULES&apos; When large chunks break off of glaciers, the process is known as calving.

(Negotiators blame policy disagreements rather than the emails.) 12/24/09 to 1/4/10: According to polling by Yale and George Mason University, 80 percent of conservatives who followed the Climategate scandal say they now have less trust in scientists as a result. Global warming isn’t happening. Sixty-nine percent of all respondents who followed the story, and 94 percent of conservatives, agree with the statement that “scientists changed their results to make global warming appear worse than it is”—an allegation later shown to be completely false. February 2010: Two months after calling for climate action, Trump declares that global warming is a hoax—an allegation he’ll repeat many times in the years to come.	2
In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Obama pledged to let Congress act first. “We will wait until Congress has definitively said ‘No,’” Mr. Obama said, “before we say anything definitive about my executive authority here.” He added: “I’m not going to be forward leaning on what I can do without Congress before I’ve tested what I can do with Congress.” Mr. Obama said that the global climate deal that he helped to strike in Paris this month will survive intact no matter who follows him as president. You now have a global marketplace for clean energy that is stable and accelerating. He said that the great environmental victories of the previous 50 years were all accompanied by warnings from business interests that the new rules would ruin the economy, including efforts to clean the air, water and eliminate acid rain. But in each case, the costs were lower and efforts easier than any of the critics predicted, he said.	1
It’s remarkable that the website of “NO on 23,” the leading opponent, never mentions greenhouse gases, and mentions climate change only once. Instead, the site talks about air pollution, dirty energy, and green jobs. Fighting global warming, the stated purpose of AB32, is a loser with California voters. The League of Conservation Voters declares Prop 23 a “threat to California’s landmark air pollution standards.” This is nonsense. California has a long history of reducing air pollution.	1
Speakers from coal giant Peabody Energy, among others, will make a presentation to highlight the role that coal and other fuels can play in curbing the impacts of rising temperatures. A White House spokesman said in a statement that the discussion aimed to build on the administration’s efforts to promote fossil fuels at the G20 meeting this year. Fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future. As you can imagine, the BBC is very unhappy about this. So too are all the renewables bloodsuckers: “Fossil fuels having any role in tackling climate change is beyond absurd.	1
It had been off the grid for awhile but is restored here. Have a listen and see whether he’s changed his tune on global warming. Humans have a role and therefore as a matter of prudence we ought to have less carbon loading of the atmosphere. 9:41 p.m. | Addenda | Jon Huntsman appears to join the climate shape shifters, according to NBC. There’s more on the many iterations of Gingrich’s climate stance from Glenn Kessler on the Fact Checker blog of the Washington Post (seen via Climate Progress).	0
[*] Conversely, President Obama can find a physics Nobelist to suit his policies. I recently interviewed Burton Richter, a physics Nobelist making a big push for a climate-friendly energy revolution, but also had an e-mail exchange earlier this year with Ivar Giaever, a winner of the physics Nobel who sees pronouncements of dangerous human-driven warming as more religious than scientific. The global warming has become a new religion. Please see the statement from the American Physical Society where it is stated: The evidence is incontrovertible; i.e. it can’t be discussed, just like religion.	2
The global warming crowd can’t get any crazier. Among frenzied climate watchers, cows have long been a suspicious bunch. A 2012 United Nations report found that the earth’s cattle population actually produces more carbon dioxide than automobiles, planes, and all other forms of transport combined.	2
Between 2008 and 2016, they collected answers to questions about energy and climate policies from nearly 5,700 Republican voters and more than 6,000 Democratic voters. In their analysis published today in the journal Climatic Change, they found that Republicans living in Democratic-held congressional districts “tend to be somewhat more concerned with climate change.” In blue enclaves like New York City, Miami, San Francisco, and their surrounding areas, the number can soar to 66 percent. Global warming is mainly caused by human activity. Nationwide, only 31 percent of Republicans believe that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet, while 46 percent believe that climate change is caused naturally. This idea is particularly pronounced in Montana’s lone district, where only 24 percent of Republicans believe that humans are to blame for the warming planet.	0
This week’s fire, however, is on another level. The Greenland fire evolution since July 29 as captured by @ESA_EO ‘s #sentinel2 pic.twitter.com/Iuk9blyui9 — Stef Lhermitte (@StefLhermitte) August 9, 2017 What’s striking about the Greenland fire is that it fits a larger trend of rapid change across the northern reaches of the planet. Across the entire Arctic, forests are burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years. By American standards, the Greenland fire is small, covering around 1,200 acres (about two square miles)—about the size of midtown Manhattan. The massive Lodgepole Complex wildfire that scorched eastern Montana in July—the largest fire in the country this year—was more than 200 times bigger.	1
Putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions would be central for getting global warming under control. More than 40 governments around the world, including the European Union and California, have now put a price on carbon, either through direct taxes on fossil fuels or through cap-and-trade programs. But many of them have found it politically difficult to set a price high enough to spur truly deep reductions in carbon emissions.	0
The discussion has centered on a new study reviewing how anthropogenic global warming was characterized in more than 12,000 climate science papers between 1991 and 2011. More than 97 percent of the papers stating a cause for warming, the authors found, pointed to humans. Humans are causing global warming. (Read my e-mail exchange with two authors for more background.) The clear message of the team conducting this fresh assessment of the climate science consensus is that it’s vital to close that gap to have a chance of breaking societal deadlock on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.	0
Almost nothing in his celebrated book has come to fruition, but on the food front, the world is better fed now than any time in human history. In fact, a recent study found that the world is getting too fat because there is too much food available! There’s no sign of global warming hurting productivity yet. “But the IPCC – which seems to be immune from facts – continues to insist that global warming is hurting our crops… when there’s really no observational evidence for it. They are more and more in the realm of theory which is increasingly divorced from observation from the real world.” Spencer also showed attendees a graph showing how the world has turned greener over the last century.	2

 (Reuters) A co-founder of Greenpeace told lawmakers there is no evidence man is contributing to climate change, and said he left the group when it became more interested in politics than the environment. Patrick Moore, a Canadian ecologist and business consultant who was a member of Greenpeace from 1971-86, told members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee environmental groups like the one he helped establish use faulty computer models and scare tactics in promoting claims man-made gases are heating up the planet. There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years. Even if the planet is warming up, Moore claimed it would not be calamitous for men, which he described as a “subtropical species.” Skeptics of manmade climate change say there is no evidence the Earth is warming. A UN report on the scientific data behind global warming released in September indicated that global surface temperatures have not increased for the past 15 years, but scientists who believe climate change due to man is occurring say it has merely paused because of several factors and will soon resume.	2
When this is combined with the media mania for the “front-page thought,” you can end up with what I call the “Katrina-ization” of global warming in this exchange. Here’s Huybers: There’s a reporting bias. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is going to go unstable. I just was involved in writing a paper that said we don’t really know and here are some issues, and it’ll be published somewhere else and that’s fine. But what you hear about on the grand scale is tailored toward catastrophe….	0
Well, okay, just burn his feet, or something. The carbon emissions of burning witches haven’t been studied carefully enough yet. The data isn’t lining up with the Church of Global Warming. That lowest circle of climate hell is reserved for Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, and Mike Huckabee, and of course the infamous heretic James Inhofe in the Senate category. Basically, if you’ve ever made a public statement about the Climategate emails that proved certain researchers were deliberate fudging the data to make it look like global warming was happening, you’re the worst.	2
How dare I ask for substance…) Lomborg’s main prescription, derived in part from his periodic consultations with panels of prominent economists, is to invest heavily in research on non-polluting energy technology and countermeasures to greenhouse heating, collectively known as geo-engineering. (He reprises his geo-engineering push in a forthcoming issue of Time Magazine.) A modest carbon tax could pay for all of this work at a fraction the cost of a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases, the approach pursued by Europe under the Kyoto Protocol (and rejected in the United States). Does the film succeed? “Cool It” is eminently watchable — which is no surprise given Timoner’s involvement.	1
Anyone who questioned the prevailing belief would upset the peace of the community. Dyson’s refusal ever to accommodate himself with the modish notions of the hour may explain why, unlike some of his less distinguished and brilliant contemporaries over the years, he has never been awarded a Nobel Prize. I am hoping that the scientists and politicians who have been blindly demonizing carbon dioxide for 37 years will one day open their eyes and look at the evidence.	2
The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has never been higher. This was the most recent environmental milestone in a year that has been marked by the Trump administration dismantling many Obama-era environmental policy initiatives. CO2 is especially significant because it traps heat in the atmosphere and is seen as being one of the primary contributors to global warming.	0
Just when you think the global warming crowd can’t get any crazier, you find that they are now researching how to minimize the noxious effects of cow-belching on the environment by tweaking the bovine diet. Among frenzied climate watchers, cows have long been a suspicious bunch. The earth’s cattle population actually produces more carbon dioxide than automobiles, planes, and all other forms of transport combined. Moreover, the cow pies they drop and the wind they break produce a third of the world’s twenty-times-more-detrimental methane emissions. This past summer, EcoWatch published an article reiterating that greenhouse gas emissions from livestock actually account for a higher percentage of total global emissions than the world’s 1.2 billion automobiles.	1
One of the first commitments made through CFC is a planting project on a rare parcel of open space in the City of Shoreline, just north of Seattle, funded by Bank of America through American Forests. According to a study by the nonprofit Forest Trends, in 2016, $662 million globally went toward the purchase of carbon offsets for the protection or restoration of forests and other natural landscapes. For-profit carbon project developers work with landowners to qualify large forests for credits. Doubters have questioned whether city trees offer enough scale to be worthwhile, McPherson noted. “Carbon developers are thinking they want to lock up 10,000 acres of forest land, so they don’t see the scale or the volume in what we’re doing.” But Governali said that for King County, the carbon protocol offers something different—a way to protect a lot of urban green space cumulatively by selling credits over time, and for many small green spaces.	1
"This isn&apos;t the first time it&apos;s been spotted, having appeared last year for a brief period as well, and long before that it was detected back in the 1970s. However, it disappeared for several decades before showing back up, throwing a huge kink in many scientific explanations for its existence. At that time, the scientific community had just launched the first satellites that provided images of the sea-ice cover from space. ""On-site measurements in the Southern Ocean still require enormous efforts, so they are quite limited."" The current best guess is that warmer salt water from deep under the ice has managed to squeeze its way through the cold layer of fresh water that typically insulates it, causing a warm patch and ultimately melting the ice and forming a huge gap."	1
More recently, Intrepid is reducing the number of internal flights within itineraries to cut down on its carbon emissions, including its popular China and Iran trips. For the first time, a few of its 2019 Iran itineraries will have no flights at all; Mr. Barnes said that travelers will use overnight trains instead. Air travel produces far more carbon emissions than train travel. Then there’s Roar Africa, a specialist in luxury Africa vacations. Their clients receive recyclable glass water bottles from their guides as soon as they land in Africa that they can use throughout their trips.	1
I think my model from long ago showed that extreme flooding would become increasingly common with development. From the numbers in your article, it looks like there has been quite a lot of increase in urban area. The increase in extreme flood likelihood will occur prior to reaching 73-percent urbanization because of changes in climate. While I argue for newer, updated modeling, I also jump to what we can do in terms of engineering to reduce major flooding. First there has to be motivation for it, as you pointed out in the article.	0
They wanted to see whether floods with similar flow rates produced different flood heights before and after levee construction. They found that in all 13 cases, for floods of the same flow rate, water heights post-levee were higher than pre-levee—in one instance by more than 5 feet. The study used real-world data to show what actually happened during floods, instead of relying on a model of what “should” happen. Scientists say stream gauges near every levee could serve as a warning system, indicating which levees worsen flooding and delivering a reality check on the Corps’ design predictions. But the Geological Survey and other agencies have struggled to maintain their network of gauges.	1
(REUTERS/Peter Andrews/Files) The computers were wrong. There’s still hope for Planet Earth. Global warming is occurring more slowly than computer models forecast a decade ago. The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, does not contradict the scientists’ concerns that global warming is dramatically damaging the environment, but it does suggest that it’s not too late to do something about it. Scientists have long held that a 2-degree Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) increase in the earth’s temperature would be a tipping point for the environment, and multiple studies have projected that figure to be reached by the end of the century.	2
The Yale Project on Climate Change Communication has grudgingly acknowledged that a November 2013 poll found that the number of Americans who think global warming is a myth has climbed to 23%, up seven percentage points since April 2013. The poll also found that those who believed in global warming remained roughly the same, but those who were undecided dropped six percentage points, leading to the conclusion that many of those who were once vacillating now disbelieve global warming. Human emissions of greenhouse gases are causing global warming. But 37% of Americans say that nature itself is responsible. A study published in November 2013 by the Royal Meteorological Society said that talk of a slowdown in global warming is incorrect.	0
Peabody is just the tip of the iceberg. We are going to be seeing reports like this for the next 20 years. The value of a global push to limit the human contribution to warming exceeds the economic value of abundant fossil energy. Keith Bradsher’s article on China’s energy concerns trumping its climate worries provides supporting evidence. At the recent “Moving by Degrees” conference organized by the Marketplace radio program, even Climate Progress blogger Joe Romm put long odds on game-changing climate disruption occurring before the 2020s.	0
It is going to backfire horribly, as I’m about to demonstrate. Before we move onto the threadbare science in Parker’s arguments, let’s just first marvel at the way she has tried to blame Breitbart for something it did not do. Global warming is not expected to end anytime soon. Though we would prefer to focus on our usual coverage of weather and climate science, in this case we felt it important to add our two cents — especially because a video clip from weather.com (La Niña in Pacific Affects Weather in New England) was prominently featured at the top of the Breitbart article. Breitbart had the legal right to use this clip as part of a content-sharing agreement with another company, but there should be no assumption that The Weather Company endorses the article associated with it.	0
may also take steps to introduce so-called market-based measures that would set a price on carbon. This would create economic incentives for shippers to adopt new fuels and technologies, which are likely to be costly. A clear switch away from fossil fuels is now on the cards. We call these features “One Thing You Can Do.” In fact, there are a lot of things you can do. Figuring out how you can best help the environment can get overwhelming.	1
Those questioning the vulnerability of this species to warming will point to its successful survival through two previous warm intervals between ice ages as evidence the bear can deal with reduced ice and other big environmental shifts. Finally, there are basic questions about the robustness of the conclusions, which are based on a new line of genetic analysis not previously applied to polar bears. This work bolsters the view of scientists who’ve been calling for a conservation strategy for polar bears and other ice-dependent species focused on areas of the Arctic where sea ice is projected to endure well into this greenhouse-heated era. Watch this presentation.] James Gorman of the science staff at The Times captures this complexity well in his news story: The report comes to no conclusion about how sensitive the bears are to the current loss of the sea ice that they live on, and the evolutionary tale it presents can be read in different ways.	1
Still, we can invest our efforts in new development as wisely as possible, choosing solar over coal and biodiversity over factory farms. In coming centuries, I believe we’ll strive to make the anthropocene comfortable for as many species as possible, if only for the selfish reason that it will make us comfortable too. In the very act of inventing tools to improve the environment, we will come closer to understanding our place on the planet, as well as in a global society of creatures like ourselves. By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion. Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where humans are already shaping climate and the web of life.	1
It causes stormy conditions over the North Atlantic when it is in a positive, low-pressure phase. [Video: Arctic Sea Ice Continues To Thin] In the past decade, the Arctic ice-cap extent has bobbed back and forth among top 10 record lows, all the while continuing an overall steady decline that started in the 1970s. Since 1978, the winter Arctic ice cap has shrunk by 12 percent per decade. The lowest winter maximum on record occurred in 2011, when the sea ice extended 5.65 million square miles (14.63 million square km). On the other hand, the proportion of so-called multiyear ice was higher this year than in 2013: About 43 percent of this year&apos;s ice was more than a year old, compared to only 30 percent last winter.	1
We warmly welcome the report’s message of hope, which confirms the fact that climate change is more than just a technical or financial challenge (as Pope Francis did in his encyclical letter on June 18) and confirms the voice of health in the discussion on climate change. Indeed, the central premise of the Lancet commission’s work is that tackling climate change could be the single greatest health opportunity of the 21st century. Climate change has the potential to set back global health. The greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our planet come from industrial activity that pollutes our air and water, and the temperature changes may lead to drought that brings malnutrition. Those with little or no access to health care — children and the elderly in particular — are more vulnerable to such predicaments.	0
The CO2 Coalition has questions about the second part of that assertion, and a serious argument with the third. The Coalition’s new white paper, Carbon Dioxide Benefits the World: See for Yourself, reviews the current state of climate science with particular attention to its biological impact. Global temperature increases have been far, far less than doomsday computer models predicted – about three times smaller. Not only has this warming been small, but there is no real reason to think it’s harmful. On the contrary, while alarmist claims of increased catastrophic weather phenomenon are easily debunked, and their warnings of rising sea levels remain highly speculative, it’s hard to argue with the verifiable increase in plant life across much of the world.	2
Most scientists, politicians and journalists have learned that they will have a quieter life if they just drift along with what most scientists privately concede is sheer exaggeration. Believers also insist there is a “consensus” that manmade global warming is likely to prove dangerous. Recent global warming is not only manmade but dangerous. Millions die worldwide every year because they do not have cheap, clean, continuous, low-tech, coal-fired power. Given the growing and now flagrant discrepancies between prediction and observation that we have revealed here for the first time, the moral case for defunding the profiteers of climate doom and redeploying the money to give coal-fired light and heat to the world’s poorest people is overwhelming.	0
"The melting in the area ""increases the risk of multiple meters (more than 10 feet) sea level rise over the next century or so,"" Rignot said. The melting seen in West Antarctica and the Antarctica Peninsula account for about four-fifths of the ice loss. Global sea levels have risen approximately 8 inches over the past century, with sea-level rises getting higher in some parts of the globe. Coastal areas, such as Florida, Bangladesh and cities like London and Shanghai are at risk. THESE WATER MOLECULES HAVE BEEN SITTING UNTOUCHED IN THE DEEP PACIFIC FOR 700 YEARS In 2017, a study suggested that New York City could be in danger of getting hit with storms that occurred once every 500 years, every five years."	1
Here is what it means for the planet, business, politics and other areas. President Obama, who regards tackling climate change as a central element of his legacy, spoke of the deal in a televised address from the White House. This agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is fully committed to a low-carbon future. “We’ve shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge.” Scientists and leaders said the talks here represented the world’s last, best hope of striking a deal that would begin to avert the most devastating effects of a warming planet. Mr. Ban said there was “no Plan B” if the deal fell apart.	1
Environmental activists should stop talking about global warming because no one cares. Instead they should talk about stuff that tugs at the heart strings, like cancer, kids with asthma, and “25,000 people dying every day from pollution.” This is what Arnold Schwarzenegger told a meeting at the UN’s climate conference in Bonn, Germany. People do not focus as much on 2 degrees energy increases in temperatures or increases in sea levels rising. And in propaganda terms, he is absolutely right. In fact, Arnie displays such an excellent understanding of the black arts here, he could almost be channelling his most infamous former compatriot, Adolf Hitler.	1
Update, 3:40 p.m. | * At the asterisk above, I incompletely described the genesis of the Hallegatte paper, leaving out the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Update, 3:53 p.m. | I just recalled that my old friend Mike Lemonick wrote an excellent piece in 2012 for Climate Central focused on the response of coastal communities in Florida to sea-level realities. Global warming is really such a big deal. “I tell them, ‘the ocean is rising,’ ” he said. “They say, ‘so?’ It drives you crazy.” London is no scientist; he’s a city commissioner in Hallandale Beach, Fla., a municipality of about 37,000 that sits on the Atlantic coast between Fort Lauderdale and Miami.	0
The agency estimated, based on the new figures, that China’s carbon dioxide pollution in 2011 and 2012 was 4 percent to 6 percent greater than previously thought. But some scientists said the difference could be much larger. China had released about 900 million metric tons more carbon dioxide from 2011 to 201. That would be an 11 percent increase in emissions, he said. For comparison, the International Energy Agency estimated before the revision that China had emitted 8.25 billion tons of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels in 2012.	1
"Methane is a greenhouse gas that disappears more quickly than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but has more warming power than carbon dioxide. Millions of tons of methane are frozen in Arctic permafrost, both on land and in the seafloor. Rapid warming in the Arctic could upset these deposits, melting them and freeing the gas. This would boost the planet&apos;s greenhouse gas levels and could accelerate climate change. ""Now we have a study site where we can monitor these locations and see how they change,"" said David Valentine, a geochemist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study."	0
In an interview for the study, one senior manager at the insurance company summed it up like this: “Look, that was all a nice thing to have in good times but now we’re in hard times. We get back to core stuff.” Recent research seems to confirm the findings. Fossil fuel emissions hit an all-time high in 2017 as carbon dioxide emissions surged for the first time in three years. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions—greenhouse gases that each trap 30 and 300 times more heat than carbon dioxide—are also on the rise, European Union scientists said last month. Meanwhile, companies are barely making a dent, making it only 31 percent of the way to reducing emissions to levels needed to keep the world from warming beyond the point scientists say climate change will become unmanageable, a study released last month by the green investor nonprofit CDP found.	1
In the map below, darker shades of blue indicate higher percentages of Republicans who reject climate science. Perhaps most confusingly, 36 percent of Republicans nationwide believe that global warming will harm people in the United States, but only 32 percent are worried about it. Global warming will harm Americans. By contrast, overwhelming majorities of Democratic voters in all states are worried about global warming and believe that manmade activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are to blame. In October, the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization revealed that carbon dioxide levels grew at a record pace in 2016.	0
As of November 2016, 16 states had adopted them, and the guidelines are under consideration in several others. Efforts to undermine science education are often related to adoption of the new standards. Human activity has increased carbon dioxide emissions and affected the climate. In Wyoming, lawmakers passed a statute banning public schools from teaching climate change is caused by humans, though that was later repealed. Also in 2016, Idaho lawmakers passed a bill permitting the use of the Bible in public schools as long as it was in connection with astronomy, biology, and geology.	0
I think that videos like the one above can help clarify what’s going on, and will be helpful in classrooms, particularly. They might help the human species go to “risk school.” But, as I explained to Gell-Mann then, I don’t see better communication, on its own, being remotely sufficient to set the world on a course to shift swiftly from the fuels of convenience — coal and oil — even as human numbers and resource appetites crest. If the media put global warming front and center on nightly newscasts and front pages and homepages, people would line up to fight the climate crisis. The challenge, of course, is that a science-based definition of the “climate crisis” (I still think that climate scientist Richard Somerville defined that term best in a 2007 debate with Michael Crichton and others) is not the kind of message that will get people rushing to the ramparts. There’s a coda to the conversation with Gell-Mann in which I propose a way to get traction on a shift toward new energy norms despite the unavoidable public detachment from climate change, on its own terms.	0
As climate alarmists rend their garments over fossil fuel emissions, a group of scientists has discovered that the world’s plants have somehow increased their capacity to assimilate carbon, resulting in an actual decline in the percentage of human-produced CO2 remaining in the atmosphere. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have found to their surprise that despite the increased human emissions of greenhouse gases, between 2002 and 2014, plants were somehow able to absorb more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than in previous decades. Terrestrial ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and offset a large fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. “That portion that stays in the atmosphere — that’s called the airborne fraction,” said Trevor Keenan, one of the report’s authors, “has reduced by about 20% over the last 15 years.” Not only that, over the past 50 years, “the amount of CO2 absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial biosphere annually has more than doubled,” the report states, and “global warming over vegetated land notably slowed since the start of the twenty-first century.” Since the start of the twenty-first century, the researchers state, “the airborne fraction has been declining (−2.2% per year), despite the rapid increase in anthropogenic emissions.” The decline is clearly visible in this accompanying chart, which shows the airborne fraction dropping after 2002 and breaking with the historical upward trend. The red line indicates rising levels between 1960 and 1990, while the blue line shows them dropping significantly following 2002.	1
Had there been no man-made warming, 2017 would have been average or slightly cooler than normal, said National Center for Atmospheric Research climate scientist Ben Sanderson. On the other hand, NASA calculated if the temperature contributions of El Nino and El Nina were removed from the global data through the years, 2017 would go down as the hottest year on record, NASA chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt said. Carbon pollution is like putting the Earth on an escalator of rising temperatures, with natural variation such as El Nino or the cooling effect of volcanoes like hopping up or down a step or two on that escalator. Not every year will be warmer than the last because of natural variations, but the trend over years will be rising temperatures, they said. The observed warming has been predicted within a few tenths of a degree in computer simulations going back to the 1970s and 1980s, several scientists said.	0
In fact, the polling data suggest that the public has over-reacted to that message. The new Stanford/Reuters poll shows that the public is more convinced than ever that climate warming is happening and LESS convinced that humans are to blame. Global warming will never hurt anyone. Just 1% of Tea Partiers think that there is a more than 80% chance that humans are primarily to blame for climate change (ie, an IPCC-like statement of attribution). Yet the PNAS 2010 paper that Steve Schneider co-authored shows that 97-98% of the most influential climate scientists think the IPCC-like attribution statement is correct.	2
In animal studies, these chemicals were shown to be harmful to the immune system, reproductive system, nervous system and endocrine system, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Similarly wide-ranging effects are likely in humans as well, and PCBs can increase the likelihood of various health problems, including cancer, EPA studies have shown. If human-driven climate change continues on the present course, the ice covering the site could begin to melt in about 75 years. It would be much longer before the base itself would become exposed, but in the meantime, meltwater could move through the ice, saturating structures in the base and carrying toxic waste with it as it flows to the coast, they said. The new study details the history of Camp Century, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers military base that was built in the Greenland Ice Sheet in 1959.	0
It has become a political and environment agenda item, but the science is not valid,” he declared. Coleman insists that there is no credible evidence of man-made warming, nor has there ever been. The theory that carbon dioxide is a pollutant has not been substantiated scientifically. “There has been no warming over 18 years,” Coleman said. Coleman said he bases his conclusions on the very Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports that climate change believers say proves their case.	2
And certainly if China’s gas push comes with the same wasteful, leaky practices that American oil and gas companies have only slowly abandoned (and that still abound in Russia and elsewhere), that’s not a reasonable bridge at all. Nothing I, or anyone else writes, will change the reality that the gas age is here for many years to come. Progress in avoiding environmental regrets can come through constructive discussion of ways to cut risks and waste and to sustain a long-term energy quest that extends beyond fossil fuels even while they remain abundant and cheap. That’s no easy task. By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion.	0
Most global warming is natural and even if there had been no Industrial Revolution current global temperatures would be almost exactly the same as they are now. The paper, by Australian scientists John Abbot and Jennifer Marohasy, published in GeoResJ uses the latest big data technique to analyse six 2,000 year-long proxy temperature series from different geographic regions. “Proxies” are the markers scientists use – tree rings, sediments, pollen, etc – to try assess global temperature trends in the days before the existence of thermometers.	2
In October, she sought help from a psychiatrist who put her on an antidepressant. “It sort of saps your emotional reserves,” she says, “this constant background feeling of anxiety.” Forty percent of Americans reported hearing about climate change in the media at least once a month in 2015, and about half said they were worried about the topic that year, making it “a powerful environmental stressor,” according to a 2016 federal report. And that’s not the only way global warming causes psychological problems. Research suggests that heat waves affect our neural regulation, weakening our ability to regulate our emotions, and that people are more aggressive and less empathetic during warm periods. As Stanford University researcher Sanjay Basu put it to me, “We kind of lose our cool.” Indeed, evidence suggests a connection between rising temperatures and suicide.	0
The press office of Columbia University’s Earth Institute* is particularly good at its job — and it’s a job that’s ever more vital as traditional news media coverage of science shrinks. The release below, on work clarifying what did — and didn’t — contribute to the extraordinary snows of last winter is a prime example of a solid, contextualized account. The winter conditions either debunked or supported the picture of human-driven global warming. Converging Weather Patterns Caused Last Winter’s Huge Snows A Warming World Can Still See Severe Storms The memory of last winter’s blizzards may be fading in this summer’s searing heat, but scientists studying them have detected a perfect storm of converging weather patterns that had little relation to climate change. The extraordinarily cold, snowy weather that hit parts of the U.S. East Coast and Europe was the result of a collision of two periodic weather patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, a new study in the journal Geophysical Research Letters finds.	1
______ Now here’s an interesting opener for a story about the new global economy: “China’s vibrant technology scene is searching for people like Shen Yue. Qualifications: Must be attractive, know how to charm socially awkward programmers and give relaxing massages.” Hats off to the writer, Sui-Lee Wee, who pitched this story at our correspondents meeting in Hong Kong a few months ago. Damage to Great Barrier Reef From Global Warming Is Irreversible. • Trump Decides American Envoy Headed to Australia Will Go to Seoul Instead: The decision to nominate Adm. Harry Harris as the ambassador to South Korea is seen as a diplomatic blow to Australia, a close American ally. • Diary of a Song: Watch how Australian songwriter Sarah Aarons and her producing team made “The Middle,” which started as a voice memo and ended up being an international hit.	0
In fact, the polling data suggest that the public has over-reacted to that message.

What we observed at SHEBA (and see in Barrow on a regular basis) is that for thinner (&lt; 2 m) multiyear ice and first-year ice, melt ponds can fill with seawater by the end of the melt season (due to higher permeabilities of such thinner, more porous ice), resulting in the overlaying of desalinated old ice by newly frozen saline ice in the fall and winter. As a consequence, a significant fraction of the multi-year ice has surface emissivity signatures of first-year ice.” Yet more evidence of the hazards of putting too much emphasis on a particular paper, perhaps (in other words, supporting Dr. Betts’ point). Ice volume is a better measure than ice area. Again, I’d love you to ask your leading cryosphere scientists whether the dramatic melting we’ve seen in recent years would have occurred absent the long-term warming trend. If you’re not refuting the volume analysis, then I can’t see how you can say focusing on ice volume is “a bit funky” — it’s clearly a more important measure of the system’s ability to recover, which is the central point of this post.	1
While this concept has yet to be fully fleshed out, its broad goal of transitioning to 100% renewable energy has energized younger activists and has gained a foothold among established Democrats. The sense of urgency has been highlighted by a series of sobering reports released by scientists over the past year. The world has little more than a decade to limit catastrophic climate change, which will involve millions of people displaced by sea level rise or subjected to deadly heatwaves, as well as the loss of almost all of the planet’s coral reefs. About two-thirds of Americans believe that global warming is influencing the weather, in the wake of a string of deadly extreme events in the US. About half say the disastrous wildfires in California and Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which flattened parts of North Carolina and Florida, were worsened because of rising global temperatures.	0
A new Pew Research Center survey, released as Pope Francis publishes an encyclical on the environment and climate change, finds that 71% of self-identified American Catholics believe the earth is getting warmer, but only 47% attribute the perceived warming to human activity. Additionally, 48% of U.S. Catholics consider global warming to be a very serious problem, while 46% of the general public believes the same. There is no solid evidence of global warming. The survey demonstrates that global warming is a highly politicized issue that breaks U.S. Catholics down along the lines of their political parties, as well as their race and ethnicity. Pew notes that in the survey, 34% of Catholic participants identified themselves as Democrats, while 24% described themselves as Republicans, and 31% as independents.	2
Yes the income tax cuts for low and lower middle income earners are an important feature of the scheme, along with the higher tax threshold which means that ~1m people don’t need to file tax returns. It’ll also make it harder for a possible future Abbott government to roll back the scheme. People will need to see that no catastrophes eventuate on the day the carbon price comes in. 2. Correct, there will be practically no impact on coal exports from the policy.	1
Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, sent a video message of support. “We have tremendous natural resources, from coal to natural gas to oil, to generate electricity in a very cost-effective way,” Mr. Pruitt told the conference. Global warming is occurring. “There’s a debate in the United States between the denialists who pooh-pooh any thought about climate change and the catastrophic dangers it portends, and those who agree with the scientific academies of every country in the world that we’re facing an existential threat and we have to do something about it,” Governor Brown said Saturday. Two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.	0
This pattern is repeated through the major findings. Summary statements are phrased to give the impression of greater certainty and larger impacts than either the text of the report or the earlier FAR support. There is low confidence in attribution of drought on a global scale to human influence on climate. As another example, the report discusses how changes in the El Nino weather phenomenon and in ocean currents have contributed to recent extreme weather events. But then the USGCRP report admits that there is little evidence of human influence on past changes in either El Nino or ocean currents.	2
Tomorrow you’re going up to New York City, where you’re going to, I assume, see people who are still suffering the effects of Hurricane Sandy, which many people say is further evidence of how a warming globe is changing our weather. What specifically do you plan to do in a second term to tackle the issue of climate change? The political will exists in Washington to pass legislation that could include some kind of a tax on carbon. A. You know, as you know, Mark, we can’t attribute any particular weather event to climate change.	1
However, the U.N. notes that some parts of the world, such as the coast of California, saw sea levels fall. Ollier and Parker say their study calls into question the accuracy of the established estimates on sea level rise, because the PSMSL and the U.N. say sea levels are rising in the Indian Ocean despite raw data like that in the image pictured above. World sea levels are rising on average. Maxim Lott can be reached on Twitter at @maximlott	0
With one fair, transparent and comprehensive market correction, you reduce emissions, drive the transition to renewables, create jobs and stimulate consumer spending. Even Big Oil has begun lobbying for a carbon fee. The world will soon do something about global warming. The majority of Americans and economists also support a carbon fee. Solving global warming will not be easy.	0
Game over for the deniers, now dramatically disarmed of their most powerful weapon by “the Science”? Er, not quite, no, as this exquisitely damning rebuttal from the Global Warming Policy Forum makes clear. Far from staying flat since 1998, global temperatures have carried on rising. It’s just that scientists haven’t noticed before because they’ve been looking in the wrong place – on land, rather than in the sea where all the real heat action is happening. And how did Karl et al notice what everyone else has missed until now?	0
"That also proved wrong. But people should still be concerned about global warming, Fitzpatrick says. The paper in no way diminishes the extensive body of observations that global warming is happening and that it is largely due to human activity. ""Global surface temperature is still rising ... 2012 was in the top ten warmest years on record. The period 2001-2010 was the warmest on record since instrumental measurements began,"" she added."	0
Here’s more music in the key of carbon. The songwriter and guitarist David Wilcox has posted a YouTube video of a fresh-penned tune, “Crude Greed,” reflecting on the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster (there’s a fun cat-stretching moment over his shoulder): . Liberated carbon makes our society possible. Hold on to your hat for this high-octane tune, which echoes Ziggy Stardust to my ear. By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion.	1
 This color-coded map displays global temperature anomaly data from 2014. Global temperatures in 2014 shattered earlier records, making 2014 the hottest year since record-keeping began in 1880. Every continent set heat records last year, and the Pacific Ocean was unusually warm despite a no-show El Niño. The warmth on land and in the oceans broke previous temperature records set in 2005 and 2010, the scientists with NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced.	0
The jet set loves to lecture the rest of us about how air travel is the worst source of carbon pollution, but apparently their airborne emissions don’t count, sort of like how everything we eat at Thanksgiving dinner is calorie-free because it’s a magical holiday. A 2013 analysis at the New York Times described air travel as “the most serious environmental sin” committed by the Little People. One round-trip flight from New York to Europe or to San Francisco creates a warming effect equivalent to 2 or 3 tons of carbon dioxide per person. “The average American generates about 19 tons of carbon dioxide a year; the average European, 10.” President Obama swanned off to Paris on the most fabulous private jet in the world, Air Force One, which burns about 5 gallons of jet fuel for every mile it covers. Aviation fuel supposedly releases about 21 pounds of carbon into the atmosphere per gallon, which means President Obama’s 7,656-mile round-trip to Paris will burn 38,280 gallons of fuel, and fart a whopping 803,880 pounds of carbon into the biosphere.	0
Ron Sachs/CNP/Zuma This story was originally published by New Republic and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. It became clear early in Donald Trump’s presidency that many of his top officials shared a common trait: They were climate deniers. Carbon dioxide is not a “primary contributor” to global warming. Nine months into Trump’s presidency, he continues to nominate climate deniers to key spots in his administration. The latest denier of note is Trump’s nominee to lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Oklahoma Congressman Jim Bridenstine.	2
Solyndra is another example. So-called “renewable” energy is cripplingly expensive to the customer but is often unprofitable even after massive subsidies from taxpayers. Europe is suffering from political rejection of fossil fuels. Theirs is not an example the U.S. should wish to follow. By withdrawing from the Paris agreement, President Trump did a wonderful thing for America and the world.	1
We are already seeing climate changing and it seems unlikely to slow down. The three R’s of adaptation — resistance, resilience, retreat — are very likely to be increasingly in play. Texas can accept that sea level is rising. We need to do research on more extreme measures (see Task Force On Climate Remediation Research). The global geo-engineering approaches are extremely hard to control both politically and physically, but in learning about them we might understand our plight and options much more clearly.	1

 File photo - A statue of the Virgin Mary is seen standing in flood waters in the lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, Louisiana Sept. 23, 2005. The federal government still lacks a comprehensive strategy to tackle floods. Katrina, which made landfall as a Category 3 hurricane in southeast Louisiana Aug. 29, 2005, killed more than 1,800 people and left millions homeless. “There has been a lot of work done in the areas that were flooded out,” Robert Traver, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Villanova University, told FoxNews.com.	1
Believers have silenced serious and legitimate scientific questions such as these by an organized, well-funded and remarkably vicious campaign of personal vilification against anyone who dares to ask any question, however polite or justifiable, about the Party Line. Most scientists, politicians and journalists have learned that they will have a quieter life if they just drift along with what most scientists privately concede is sheer exaggeration. Global warming is likely to prove dangerous. 10: Given that the authors of the largest ever survey of peer-reviewed opinion in learned papers marked only 64 of 11,944 papers, or 0.5%, as stating they agreed with the official “consensus” proposition that recent warming was mostly manmade, on what rational, evidence-based, scientific ground is it daily asserted that “97% of scientists” believe recent global warming is not only manmade but dangerous? Millions die worldwide every year because they do not have cheap, clean, continuous, low-tech, coal-fired power.	0
A diet heavy on vegetables is the best diet for the planet in this age of global warming. The 32-year-old federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has decided to add global warming to its criteria for proper nutrition and has determined that meat should be removed from our diets to help environmental sustainability. A vegan diet consisting mostly of veggies, the committee now says, is both healthier and has less of an impact on the planet.	0
Judith also agrees that the findings on volcanoes and changed to the diurnal temperature range (both discussed in the results paper) make useful contributions to the field. The disagreement comes only over Berkeley Earth’s use of a simple model fitting the temperature record for the past 250 years to human CO2 emissions and volcanoes to conclude that the best explanation for the observed warming is greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide is responsible for the warming. While the Berkeley Earth team values the simplicity of the model (indeed, in physics the simple model is generally considered the best), Curry is not convinced and thinks it is overly simplistic. These sorts of disagreements are common among scientists and contribute usefully to advancing science.	0
This relates to differing views (see comment discussions) on the merits of the phrase “Arctic death spiral.” As I’ve said, and told Holland, that phrase would be fine with me if it were stressed that there will be “loop the loops” on the way down. Here’s her note: The work pointing to periods of recovery on the way to a largely ice-free summer later in the century is still valid…. Natural variability is large for sea ice. When this reinforces the anthropogenic change, it can cause RILEs [rapid ice loss events] — but it can also counter that change and cause brief periods of near-stability (or even small increases on a decadal scale). So, given the research, I think that loop-the-loops are to be expected.	1
“Partnerships between businesses and institutions and governments can actually make a difference in combating climate change,” he said. Meanwhile, Trump’s announcement also has supporters of the Paris agreement concerned about its effects on K-12 education. Global warming is due in large part to human activity. Loewus reports that Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, says Trump’s decision to withdraw from the climate agreement will not lead to changes for teachers who are already teaching that climate change is caused by humans. “It will spur them to continue presenting climate change accurately, honestly, and constantly in the classroom,” Branch said, but added his concerns about other teachers.	0
U.S. Precipitation The report claims: Heavy precipitation events in most parts of the United States have increased in both intensity and frequency since 1901 Nope. Rainfall trends have changed little since the 1970s. Sea level rise is accelerating. There is no evidence at all for this. Homewood explains: As even the IPCC had to admit, sea level rise between 1920 and 1950 was similar to the recent period.	1
But how to achieve that lower threshold? Global emissions continue to rise, albeit slowly. A mammoth effort is needed, beginning now and carrying through the century, to decarbonize global energy systems. The next 10 years are absolutely crucial: Emissions will have to be on a sharp downward path by 2030 for any hope of success. Greenhouse gases must be cut nearly in half from 2010 levels.	0
Another notable step will come in January when the Global Tourism Resilience and Crisis Management Centre is scheduled to open at the University of the West Indies Mona Campus, in Kingston, Jamaica. The center is supported by the United Nations tourism organization and the Jamaica Tourist Board, and its chairman, Edmund Bartlett, said that its mission is to conduct research on destination preparedness, management and recovery from events — like recent hurricanes — that disrupt tourism. There appears to be hope for travel and tourism to continue to grow in the wake of global warming. “The travel world isn’t ignoring the severity of climate change,” Ms. Redman of Greenpeace said. “Many are even trying to find a way to slow down it down so that tourism can keep thriving.”	1
I particularly recommend “The ‘Unstable’ West Antarctic Ice Sheet: A Primer.” The NASA news release is clear and avoids some of the pumped-up qualities of news coverage, which is inevitably torqued by what I’ve long called “the tyranny of the front-page thought.” Here’s an excerpt describing how the measurements on the six glaciers in the study relate to projections of sea-level rise: These glaciers already contribute significantly to sea level rise, releasing almost as much ice into the ocean annually as the entire Greenland Ice Sheet. They contain enough ice to raise global sea level by 4 feet (1.2 meters) and are melting faster than most scientists had expected. These findings will require an upward revision to current predictions of sea level rise. “This sector will be a major contributor to sea level rise in the decades and centuries to come,” Rignot said. “A conservative estimate is it could take several centuries for all of the ice to flow into the sea.” So what does this mean for society?	1
Residents of North Carolina’s Outer Banks and mainland coasts have already been ordered to evacuate. President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in both North and South Carolina, and a Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator said that the Category 4 hurricane will likely cause “massive damage to our country.” And the rise in sea levels, experts say, is making the storm surge worse. Sea level rise is a direct consequence of global warming. Since 1950, the sea level has risen 6.5 inches—a number that sounds small but has actually had major consequences across the country. “Sea level rising, simply put, makes every coastal flood deeper and more destructive,” said Ben Strauss, CEO of Climate Central, a climate change research organization that has published dozens of studies about rising sea levels and the risks of ignoring the problem.	0
Is there anyone other than Philip who disagrees with that? PHILIP STOTT: I don‘t disagree with it. Global warming is not a crisis. BRIAN LEHRER: Michael Crichton, you‘re shaking your head no? MICHAEL CRICHTON: No, I don‘t think anybody objects.	2
And what all these fires have shown us is that in the face of a firestorm, we’re virtually defenseless. Here’s Scientific American failing to be scientific. More warming leads to more fires, which release more carbon, which causes more warming, and so on. The truth of course, is rather different The fires have nothing to do with “climate change.” They were a weather event – not a climate event. Meteorologist Cliff Mass (Professor, Atmospheric Sciences at University of Washington, Seattle) explains: The vegetation was dry after little rain over the summer (quite normal).	0
The carbon regulations are unconstitutional. The rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, would enforce a 32 percent reduction on greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (compared with 2005 levels). As part of the implementation, the Environmental Protection Agency would require states with at least two coal-fired power plants to submit plans for emissions reductions.	2
And the administration also rolled back protections for the sage grouse, an imperiled bird that makes its home on millions of acres of oil-rich land in the West, in a bid to spur new oil exploration. There’s some hope for a different threatened species, however. Coral reefs may be more resilient to global warming and bleaching than we think. Check out her piece to learn more, and have a great week! By Henry Fountain Each December, the guardians of writing style here at The New York Times caution reporters to avoid holiday clichés like “’tis the season” and “deck the halls.” But I’m going to violate that rule, because what I’m writing about has nothing to do with the holidays.	1
Warm water occupies more space than cooler water, a physics concept known as thermal expansion. As temperatures rise, water molecules expand, also contributing to sea level rise. Much of the rise in sea level we’ve seen since the 1880s is the result of thermal expansion. Melting glaciers, though, can worsen the situation. The Greenland ice sheet contains enough water to raise sea levels by 24 feet.	1
The odds for human extinction because of climate change or global warming are 50 percent or more. But the majority of Americans, or 58 percent, think the odds of human extinction because of climate change is less than 50 percent, revealing that climate change is not a topic of universal agreement in the United States. This divide is revealed in a Yale University report titled “Climate Change in the American Mind.” “More than half of Americans (58%) believe climate change is mostly human caused,” the Yale report states.	0
Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems. Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries. Climate change, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, excess nutrient inputs, and pollution in its many forms are fundamentally altering the chemistry of the ocean, often on a global scale and, in some cases, at rates greatly exceeding those in the historical and recent geological record. Major observed trends include a shift in the acid-base chemistry of seawater, reduced subsurface oxygen both in near-shore coastal water and in the open ocean, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increase in mercury and persistent organic pollutants. Most of these perturbations, tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer use, and industrial activity, are projected to grow in coming decades, resulting in increasing negative impacts on ocean biota and marine resources.	0
“There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years,” he said. Even if the planet is warming up, Moore claimed it would not be calamitous for men, which he described as a “subtropical species.” Skeptics of manmade climate change say there is no evidence the Earth is warming. Global surface temperatures have not increased for the past 15 years. The 2,200-page new Technical Report attributes that to a combination of several factors, including natural variability, reduced heating from the sun and the ocean acting like a “heat sink” to suck up extra warmth in the atmosphere. Moore said he left Greenpeace in the 1980s because he believed it became more interested in politics than science.	2
These uplifting findings are both bad news and good news for the frozen continent. The good news is that the uplift of supporting bedrock could make the remaining ice sheets more stable. In recent years, the rising earth has probably skewed satellite measurements of ice loss, leading researchers to underestimate the rate of vanishing ice by as much as 10 percent. [Images of Melt: Earth&apos;s Vanishing Ice] Interplay between bedrock and mantle in Antarctica is just one of the many geologic processes that happen all over our dynamic planet. Under Earth&apos;s crust cover, the molten mantle extends over 1,796 miles (2,890 kilometers) down to Earth&apos;s core.	1
The paper, written by Dr. Hansen and 18 other authors, dwells on the last time Earth warmed naturally, about 120,000 years ago, when the temperature reached a level estimated to have been only slightly higher than today. Large chunks of the polar ice disintegrated then, and scientists have established that the sea level rose 20 to 30 feet. Humanity is about to cause an equal or greater rise in sea level. The new paper argues that it could happen far more rapidly, with the worst case being several feet of sea-level rise over the next 50 years, followed by increases so precipitous that they would force humanity to beat a hasty retreat from the coasts. “That would mean loss of all coastal cities, most of the world’s large cities and all their history,” Dr. Hansen said in a video statement that accompanied the new paper.	0
Aside from preventing deadly conflagrations, protecting forests also means preserving the state’s best tool for regulating carbon emissions. By removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it as carbon in soil, branches, and tree trunks, forest have historically worked as a “carbon sink” for the state. California’s forests emitted more carbon than they sequestered. Wildfires accelerate this process. Conflagrations release carbon into the atmosphere as they burn and, once the smoke has cleared, leave fewer trees to sequester carbon.	1
"Hungry microbes gorge on the tasty carbon stored in this plant matter, and then release carbon dioxide as a natural byproduct of this feeding, just as you do when you exhaleafter a deep breath. This process is known as ""soil respiration,"" and it&apos;s an important complement to photosynthesis — the process by which plants turn CO2, water and light into energy — helping to keep ecosystems around the world running smoothly. As global temperatures rise, microbes in the soil have been releasing CO2 faster than plants can snatch it up again. Previous studies have indicated that tree roots and certain microbes both respire more frequently at higher temperatures (up until a certain point, when the intense heat causes the organisms to stop functioning completely). But the exact effects of that increase in respiration had never been studied on a global scale until now."	1
Both time frames are important, but the decadal scale is critical, given the urgent need to avoid climate-system tipping points. We also used the latest available estimates for the global warming potential of methane, while Cathles relied on older and lower values. For most uses, the GHG footprint of shale gas is greater than that of other fossil fuels on time scales of up to 100 years. When used to generate electricity, the shale-gas footprint is still significantly greater than that of coal at decadal time scales but is less at the century scale. We reiterate our conclusion from our April 2011 paper that shale gas is not a suitable bridge fuel for the 21st Century.	1
“It’s locking in that cold air at the high latitudes in the Arctic region,” Dr. Cohen said, comparing the polar vortex to a dam holding back the frigid arctic air from the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. But sometimes that dam bursts as the polar vortex weakens and allows cold air to escape the Arctic to more temperate climes. Because of climate change the warming Arctic is weakening the polar vortex. Researchers are still figuring out how the warming Arctic is triggering the polar vortex’s aberrant behavior. Some of them, including Dr. Cohen, point to melting sea ice, caused by global warming.	0
“The longer you go [into the research] you get more questions than you get answers. So, what do we really know about it? Global warming might be caused by some combination of human activity and Mother Nature. “I have to admit,” Spencer said, “adding Co2 to the atmosphere should cause some warming, but I think it’s an entirely open question… how much warming we’re going to get from adding Co2 to the atmosphere.” And this factor “makes all the difference between Al Gore’s Armageddon and ‘who cares it’s probably a beneficial thing. '” Spencer then went on to illustrate how easy it is to make assumptions based on “data” by showing a graph on the screen that showed how the rise in UFO sightings coincided with the rise in ocean temperatures and joked that maybe aliens are causing global warming.	1
There are factories like this being built in China, factories like this being built in Germany. Nobody is playing for second place. The nation that leads the clean energy economy is likely to lead the global economy. And if we fail to recognize that same imperative, we risk falling behind. We risk falling behind.	1
Europe is civil-society driven. So we should have the same target but different models of social and governance networks on this kind of issue.” Geels went on to warn about relying to much on market tools like a carbon price, saying policies fostering innovation need to be ramped up and governments must acknowledge the need to compensate losers. Exclusive emphasis on a carbon price is a delusion. [Inserted 1:55 p.m.| On that same panel, Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution, who works both on climate science and clean energy technology, said science can do far more than characterize the climate problem: “The climate community has focused a lot on presenting the vision of the future we’re trying to avoid. It’s equally, if not more, important to present the vision of the future we’re trying to create.”] In gauging the mix of insights and discussions in this plenary and throughout the meeting, I saw fresh echoes of an important 2003 paper on ecosystem resilience by Thomas Elmqvist of Stockholm University and others.	2
When temperatures soar, the electric grid comes under serious strain. Power lines also start sagging in the heat and can short out if they touch the ground or nearby foliage. Global warming could increase these risks in the future. Some possible solutions? Smarter grids and new forecasting tools could help electric utilities prepare for heat waves, using electronic controls to precool buildings before temperatures peak in the afternoon and then turning down nonessential appliances when energy demand surges, said Santiago Carlos Grijalva, a professor of electrical engineering at Georgia Tech.	0
According to a new study published in the journal Biology Letters, more than 80,000 reindeer in the Arctic died of starvation in the Novembers of 2006 and 2013 as a result of warmer, wetter Arctic falls and winters resulting from climate change. Yet as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has noted, many of the recent climatological events and trends “can be explained by the natural variability of the climate system,” without excluding an indeterminate influence from atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome.	2
“For pretty much everywhere in the world … climate change has increased the severity of heat waves.” It will take some time for scientists to be able to confidently assert the degree to which climate change has influenced this record-setting summer, but Wehner was willing to provide some preliminary estimates. For instance, he believes that climate change has increased the chance of the heat wave in Southern California 20 to 50 times over. Of course, the strongest evidence for global warming isn’t isolated events like particularly hot days. Rather, it’s an ever-growing compendium of global climate data showing consistent, undeniable trends. Though climate change is slow on a human scale, it’s happening at a blistering rate from the perspective of the Earth.	1
I am interested in having an open conversation about nuclear energy. Climate change is real. We must wean ourselves off fossil fuels. So what are the alternatives? Are renewable energy sources enough for the energy-poor around the world?	1
Global warming is a myth the greenies’ heads exploded. Since then, that figure has risen to 400 scientific papers. Can you imagine the misery and consternation and horror this is going to cause in the corrupt, rancid, rent-seeking world of the Climate Industrial Complex?	2
In order to show he’s on the right side, he has made some helpful adjustments. Here’s how he describes it on his blog. There appears to have been little or no change in globally averaged temperature over the last two decades. Because of this, we are getting a lot of questions along the lines of “I saw this plot on a denialist web site. Is this really your data?” While some of these reports have “cherry-picked” their end points to make their evidence seem even stronger, there is not much doubt that the rate of warming since the late 1990’s is less than that predicted by most of the IPCC AR5 simulations of historical climate.	2
The sense of urgency has been highlighted by a series of sobering reports released by scientists over the past year. A landmark United Nations report from last year warned that the world has little more than a decade to limit catastrophic climate change, which will involve millions of people displaced by sea level rise or subjected to deadly heatwaves, as well as the loss of almost all of the planet’s coral reefs. Global warming is influencing the weather, in the wake of a string of deadly extreme events in the US. About half say the disastrous wildfires in California and Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which flattened parts of North Carolina and Florida, were worsened because of rising global temperatures. “Global warming used to be viewed as a problem distant in time and space,” said report co-lead researcher Ed Maibach, a climate change and public health communications expert at George Mason University.	0
In a brief phone interview, a Southern Company spokesman said: “We’re meeting or exceeding all regulations in terms of climate.” “Southern Company is committed to a leadership role in finding solutions that make technological, environmental and economic sense,” he added in an email. “The focus of this effort must be on developing and deploying technologies that reduce [greenhouse gases] while making sure that energy remains reliable and affordable.” The utility has urged the Trump administration to reverse power plant rules enacted by President Barack Obama to cut back emissions. The benefits of carbon dioxide outweigh the environmental costs. “Southern Company would seem to be the individual company that’s the most Exxon-like,” Anderson said. “The move Trump is making is very much in line with what lobbyists at that company have been doing in recent years.”	2
Most days, it makes a lot more sense than politics does. In any case, whether or not there was a pause in warming for a dozen years or so has no bearing on the underlying scientific validity of climate change. The findings do not undermine global warming theory. Besides, record global temperatures for 2014 and 2015 suggest that warming has resumed. But even more important, the long-term trend is clear: Climate change is about the long haul, not short-term variability.	1
But the extent to which carbon increases crop yield hasn’t been quantified, making it somewhat “faith-based.” William Schlesinger, an emeritus soil scientist at Duke, points out that “regenerative” practices might inadvertently cause emissions to rise elsewhere. If you stop tilling to increase soil carbon, for example, but use more herbicides because you have more weeds, then you probably haven’t changed your overall emissions profile, he says. The climate-mitigation potential of carbon farming has been greatly oversold. Williams has reduced his herbicide use, not increased it, but Schlesinger’s broader point — about the need for a careful overall accounting of greenhouse gases — is important. Williams, Brown and others like them aren’t focused on climate change; no one really knows if the carbon they put in the ground more than offsets the methane produced by their cows, for example.	2
“If we can get it onto his desk, he’ll have no choice but to sign it.” Enacting legislation like the CCPA should prove popular. New York is among the most progressive states in the country on climate change according to polling data. Global warming is happening. Eighty-six percent of New Yorkers backed funding research into renewable energy, 81 percent supported regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and 79 percent called for strict emission limits on coal-fired power plants. New Yorkers overwhelmingly support environmental regulations even at an economic cost.	0
Even Al Gore, who admits he was “raised in the Southern Baptist tradition,” has declared he “could become a Catholic because of this pope.” Not surprisingly, Carl Pope, who served as executive director of the Sierra Club for 36 years, chimed in. He penned a piece published on June 22 in EcoWatch in which he bashes “American conservatism” and positions the papal publication as being responsible for a “new dynamism” that he calls “palpable.” “It is more a gale than a fresh breeze,” Pope exclaimed, “when the most ground-breaking pope since John XXIII links poverty and climate.” In his post titled “How Pope Francis’s Climate Encyclical Is Disrupting American Politics,” Pope pronounces: “Something fundamental is shifting this summer in political and cultural attitudes around the climate.” The former Sierra Club director then goes into a litany of news stories to support his position. After the most extensive and expensive global propaganda campaign, fewer people worry about a warming planet than did 25 years ago. Nor does he acknowledge that, according to the Harvard Political Review, the vast majority of Americans—even those who agree that “global warming is a proven fact and is mostly caused by emissions from cars and industrial facilities such as power plants”—remain “unsupportive of government measures to prevent climate change that might harm the economy.” And “harm the economy” it does—which is why, despite the G7 non-binding “agreement,” many European counties are returning to fossil fuels and retreating from renewables—led by German capacity payments to keep coal-fueled power plants open. In PV Magazine, Stelios Psomas, policy advisor at the Hellenic Association of Photovoltaic Companies, laments Greece’s “policy U-turn towards lignite.” Psomas said: “All [the new government] is concerned with is how to promote power generation from fossil fuels e.g.	2
"And in 1972, the Christian Science Monitor reported: ""Arctic specialist Bernt Balchen says a general warming trend over the North Pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean by the year 2000."" That also proved wrong. But people should still be concerned about global warming. ""The paper in no way diminishes the extensive body of observations that global warming is happening and that it is largely due to human activity,"" she added. ""Global surface temperature is still rising ... 2012 was in the top ten warmest years on record."	0
Mr. Pruitt: “I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. But we don’t know that yet. Human activity is primarily responsible for the rise in carbon dioxide emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the top climate-science body at the United Nations, calls carbon dioxide the biggest heat-trapping force and says that it is responsible for about 33 times more added warming than natural causes. Mr. Majkut of the Niskanen Center pointed out that some conservatives mistrust authoritative groups like the I.P.C.C., believing they have been “captured by environmental ideology.” By casting doubt on established science, Mr. Pruitt’s words reflect that skepticism, Mr. Majkut said.	0
We don’t have the expertise to do the math ourselves, but we believe in science, and whole bunches of scientists have solemnly told us that the proof of our guilt is simple: burning fossil fuels emits CO2, a greenhouse gas, making the world heat up like a greenhouse sitting in the sun. Since we the voters have accepted our guilt, our democratically elected governments have too – and when governments see guilt, they see crime. The whole world will be devastated if we don’t stop burning fossil fuels immediately (if not sooner, since some say it’s too late and the world is already doomed). With the world’s fate on the line, people in government are understandably trying their damnedest to save us – by such things as keeping our scientists all in a row. Politicians can’t expect the people, you and I, to swear off our “addiction to fossil fuels,” unless they can keep our scientists on message.	0
Carbon dioxide is a threat to public health. Moreover, it is necessary to undo the finding to prevent climate-change advocates from mounting legal challenges preventing the implementation of any executive orders on EPA regulations issued by President Donald Trump. “I assure you when the president announces that the Clean Power Plan is no longer in business the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund and every other tentacle of the green blob that you know will be in court petitioning a stay because of the endangerment finding,” Michaels said.	0
In 2006 the late Professor Robert Carter, a down-to-earth geologist who considered global warming a non-problem, wrote in the Daily Telegraph that in eight full years (1998-2005), the Hadley Centre’s global temperature dataset showed no global warming at all. Yet that dataset, which, like all the surface datasets, was recently adjusted to deliver the global warming that measurements did not show, now indicates a warming trend over those same eight years at a rate equivalent to more than 1.5 degrees/century. There had been no global warming this millennium, and why, though the two satellites continue to show little or no warming. 3: Why do all the datasets, surface as well as satellite, show a lot less warming than predicted? Why, even after the numerous questionable adjustments to the surface temperature datasets, has the rate of warming over the past quarter of a century been only one-third to one-half of the central prediction made by the UN’s climate panel in its 1990 First Assessment Report?	2
“The ice is much thinner and lighter and broken and kind of slushy,” Jennifer Francis, a scientist who focuses on the Arctic at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told Grist. “It’s been described as rotten.” The Arctic is heading toward irreversible melting and ecosystem destruction, according to the annual Arctic Report Card released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Arctic has lost nearly 95 percent of its oldest ice. On top of that, the once-pristine region is becoming quite dirty: In addition to a growing toxic algae problem, the Arctic Ocean now has the highest concentration of microplastics of any ocean on Earth. (The tiny, barely visible plastics pose a threat to any seabirds or marine life that accidentally eat them.)	1
“What can we do that genuinely does not involve subsidies to private actors or pricing? The only thing that comes to mind is the government needs to have its own power company,” Bruenig said. The world must halve global emissions or face cataclysmic global warming. But the paper goes beyond that goal, proposing lifting the geographical limitations on the TVA to create what would essentially function as a national power company and suggesting a means by which to pay for what would likely be a costly overhaul. Bruenig picked 2027—the next date in the TVA’s 10-year internal planning cycle—as the year by which the TVA should go carbon-free.	0
However, the new study would appear to confirm that the skeptics were right all along – and that it’s the alarmists who have some apologizing to do. To be clear, while mainstream climate science is replete with published proxy temperature studies showing that temperatures have cycled up and down over the last 2,000 years – spiking during the Medieval Warm Period and then again recently to about 1980 as shown in Figure 12 – the official IPCC reconstructions (which underpin the Paris Accord) deny such cycles. There is something unusual about current temperatures: that we have catastrophic global warming from industrialisation. In our new paper in GeoResJ, we not only use the latest techniques in big data to show that there would very likely have been significant warming to at least 1980 in the absence of industrialisation, we also calculate an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of 0.6°C. This is the temperature increase expected from a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere.	0
Setting aside the short-term shifts in attitudes, some survey findings that are highly relevant to the efforts by Google and its fellows were summarized by the survey team this way: If given the chance to talk to an expert on global warming, the Alarmed and Concerned would most like to know what the nations of the world can do to reduce global warming, and if there’s still time to do so. The Disengaged would most like to ask whether global warming is actually occurring, and what harm it will cause. Global warming is happening and is caused by human activities. Scientific Agreement: While approximately 97% of publishing climate scientists agree that climate change is occurring and that it is caused primarily by human activities, this high level of scientific agreement is understood by only 44 percent of the Alarmed, 18 percent of the Concerned, 12 percent of theCautious, and 5 percent or fewer of the Disengaged, Doubtful and Dismissive. I was at the Google meeting to present my view of the challenges and opportunities confronting anyone trying to convey the climate and energy challenges attending humanity’s growth spurt in ways that are both accurate and captivating: I stressed the importance of understanding social science pointing to powerful forces that predispose how people absorb the same information.	0
As far back as 2015, a flurry of academic research raised questions about whether the drop in U.S. emissions was indeed due to successful efforts to curb them or instead reflected the 2008-09 recession. At least one prominent study concluded that U.S. efforts to reduce emissions resulted mostly from economic decline, not other efforts. Global trade merely outsourced U.S. emissions. In the meantime, some climate deniers — including some in the Trump administration — have seized on earlier reports of dropping emissions to argue that aggressive U.S. emissions controls aren’t necessary. “The economy is booming, energy production is surging, and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources,” acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler wrote last October.	1
In cases such as this, researchers have to try to fit the different data chunks together like pieces of a puzzle. You can imagine how difficult it is to infer long-term trends over the past 100 years when 40 years of data are missing.” She says other studies agree with the PSMSL adjustments: “At least one study using [approximately] 20 gauges in the northern Indian Ocean, for example, found that regional sea level rise rates were on par with the global average.” Sea level change varies a lot around the world. Worldwide sea levels rose over the last two decades by about a foot per century. However, the U.N. notes that some parts of the world, such as the coast of California, saw sea levels fall. Ollier and Parker say their study calls into question the accuracy of the established estimates on sea level rise, because the PSMSL and the U.N. say sea levels are rising in the Indian Ocean despite raw data like that in the image pictured above.	1
"""Given a business-as-usual scenario of global warming, the collapse of the West Antarctic could proceed very rapidly and the West Antarctic ice masses could completely disappear within the next 1,000 years,"" says Johannes Sutter, the study&apos;s main author in comments on the Institute&apos;s website. THIS COFFIN-SHAPED ICEBERG IS HEADED TO DIE The ice sheet originally disappeared approximately 125,000 years ago, the study noted, and found that sea levels were more than 19 feet (6 meters) above present levels. Climate change has caused more than 3 trillion tons of ice to melt from Antarctica over the past 25 years ago, according to a USA Today report. In September, NASA unveiled its new $1 billion satellite, ICESat-2, to give humanity a stronger, data-backed vision of exactly how fast Earth’s ice is melting. According to the government space agency, melting ice in Greenland and Antarctica has increased the global sea level more than a millimeter per year, which is a third of the overall increase."	1
It shows no sea level rise in that part of Alaska. Kivalina may face changes due to nature, but not because of fossil fuels. Glaciers are melting at a pace unprecedented in modern times During his Alaska trip. Historians, geologists, Park employees, and glaciologists have been keeping track of glaciers for hundreds of years, and the records for Exit Glacier are no exception. The records show for more than 100 years, Exit Glacier has been retreating, but the maximum retreat rate was 300 feet per year in 1918.	1
Still not great odds, but keeping the number under a trillion in my view represents a still challenging target, but a compromise between what may be achievable and staying out of the range of climate change where truly scary things become increasingly likely. Picking a target doesn’t mean all is lost if you don’t make it, but it helps to know what you’re shooting for. Carbon emissions are growing exponentially. Any reduction in the growth rate of emissions (let alone stabilizing or reducing emissions) greatly puts off the day when we hit a trillion tonnes, and allows time for development of technology allowing a more permanent fix. By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion.	1
In the United States, we are familiar with war metaphors; and they are often politically useful. We have been through wars on poverty, drugs, cancer and even Christmas. Global warming is like a world war. “It is a world war.” War rhetoric serves a valuable function. It stresses the seriousness of the harm, its structural nature and the need to struggle against it.	0
 File photo - A surfer drops in on a large wave at Praia do Norte, in Nazare Dec. 11, 2014. A massive outpouring of carbon dioxide from the deep ocean may have helped end the last ice age. There is strong evidence that changes in Earth&apos;s orbit set the pace of the planet&apos;s ice ages, by altering how much sunlight reaches the Northern Hemisphere. Yet, carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere also wobble with the advance and retreat of massive ice sheets, according to observations of ice cores and old ocean sediments.	1
Hidden underwater melt-off in the Antarctic is doubling every 20 years and could soon overtake Greenland to become the biggest source of sea-level rise, according to the first complete underwater map of the world’s largest body of ice. Warming waters have caused the base of ice near the ocean floor around the south pole to shrink by 1,463 square kilometers—an area the size of Greater London—between 2010 and 2016, according to the new study published in Nature Geoscience. Climate change is affecting the Antarctic more than previously believed and is likely to prompt global projections of sea-level rise to be revised upward. Until recently, the Antarctic was seen as relatively stable. Viewed from above, the extent of land and sea ice in the far south has not changed as dramatically as in the far north.	0
"""Fluffy snow is like a down blanket keeping the warm summer soil away from the -40 degree winter winds,"" Church said. And trees absorb light and heat in the summer and keep cold winds out in the winter, he added. With already warmer temperatures, this leads to the melting of permafrost and the release of greenhouse gases like methane. In fact, 1,400 gigatons of carbon — the amount equivalent to 43 times as much carbon as fossil fuels and industry produced last year, according to the International Energy Agency — is at risk of escaping into the atmosphere if permafrost melts, he added. The elephants on our planet right now can&apos;t tolerate the cold climate of the steppe."	0
The earth is racing toward “global extinction” similar to the era of the dinosaurs, as half the world’s species are allegedly failing to cope with global warming. Wiens said that while we may not quite be at the level of “global extinction of entire species that have already happened,” we are unfortunately “on track for that to happen.” “If we don’t do anything,” Wiens warned, “it seems like that’s going to happen in the next 50 to 100 years.” Wiens said that the Trump election bodes badly for the future of the planet, exacerbated by his appointment of climate change skeptic Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA and his determination to pull out of the Paris Climate Change Accord (COP21). “The EPA in this country, they are the ones supposed to be protecting the environment,” he said.	0
The paper – Is the Sea Level Stable at Aden, Yemen? – examines the discrepancies between raw and adjusted sea level data in Aden, Karachi and Mumbai. Stable sea levels can be rendered to look like they are nonetheless rising at an accelerated pace. The data-adjusters take misaligned and incomplete sea level data from tide gauges that show no sea level rise (or even a falling trend). Then, they subjectively and arbitrarily cobble them together, or realign them.	2
There has been no global warming for nearly 19 years. A couple of months ago, you’ll recall, they merely claimed that the satellite data were ‘lying’. But now they’ve gone a step further.	2
Alarmist scientists have been caught red-handed tampering with raw data in order to exaggerate sea level rise. Local sea level trends in the last 140 years had been very gently rising, neutral or negative (ie sea levels had fallen). But after the evidence had been adjusted by tidal records gatekeepers at the global databank Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) it suddenly showed a sharp and dramatic rise. The whistle was blown by two Australian scientists Dr. Albert Parker and Dr. Clifford Ollier in a paper for Earth Systems and Environment.	1
After hearing the speeches, and knowing what you do about the trajectory of emissions here and overseas, what’s your personal sense of the likelihood the world will see a price on greenhouse gas emissions sufficient to shift choices in energy sources or technologies? Monson: I think it suffices to say that the motivation to effectively price carbon emissions will be impossible without a sufficient stimulus. People are linking recent weather phenomena with the concept of global warming. Hurricane Katrina, the European heat wave, flooding in Pakistan, or even the sweltering days of last summer, all of these recent events have opened peoples’ eyes to the potential dangers of global warming, even if it is difficult to definitively draw a direct connection between the two. Perhaps once the economy recovers and we rein in our foreign troops (and Democrats again take control of the House) the political discussion will shift back to climate change.	1
Battling its own smog problem, Bogotá now has a pilot project to replace its rapid transit system’s diesel-powered buses with Chinese-made electric vehicles. Officials in Madrid have gone further, with plans to make its city center car-free by 2020. The world has to begin a long-term shift from fossil fuels to more sustainable forms of energy. Recognizing “clean diesel” for the oxymoron it is would be a good place to start.	0

That fall, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt announced a proposal to end the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment, says he is confident that US renewable energy investment will continue because industry decisions will “not be decided by politics, but by the market.” The new report sends a strong message to consumers and investors that solar energy is here to stay, he says. Solar can take on fossil fuels. “Solar can compete.”	1
As Mario Lewis of the Competitive Enterprise Institute noted, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) “published a study by 13 prestigious atmospheric scientists that supposedly provides ‘clear evidence for a discernible human influence on the thermal structure of the atmosphere. '” The United Nations recently released a report that ignored data their scientists collected that found there has been pause in warming over the last 15 years. Balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate. For instance, even the if there is a “human influence” on potential global warming, the NAS study found that it is not due t greenhouse gases. NAS found that the “influence of greenhouse gases” on stratospheric temperatures “is not yet clearly identifiable” and, as Lewis notes, “they have not really found the smoking gun of man-made global warming.” “Those radical forms of social engineering, it turns out, are the real short-term threat of climate change,” he writes.	0
More storms will generate such deluges in a warming world with moister air, according to solid basic science. Slapping a label on such storms is unnecessary. It’s appropriate to call such storms “global warming type” events. Here’s Trenberth’s reply, which lies somewhat in a middle ground: I agree that not all should be so labeled. The way I think about is that for precipitation there is a shift in distribution caused by increased water vapor.	0
According to Dr. Frederick Seitz, past President of the National Academy of Sciences, “Research data on climate change do not show that human use of hydrocarbons is harmful. To the contrary, there is good evidence that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is environmentally helpful.” As Joanne Nova, Australian author, points out: “Everything on your dinner table–the meat, cheese, salad, bread, and soft drink–requires carbon dioxide to be there. Carbon dioxide is a pollutant. Science, Common Sense, and the 21st Century’s Hottest Topic.	1
Another “warm age” is a period geologists call the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which occurred about 56 million years ago. Some of the key findings of the Yale report include: • Six in ten Americans (59%) think global warming is affecting weather in the United States, and half think weather is being affected “a lot” (25%) or “some” (27%). Global warming is a relatively distant threat. They are less likely to think it will harm people in the U.S. (58%), their own grandchildren (56%) or children (50%), people in their community (48%), their family (47%), themselves (43%), or members of their extended family living outside the U.S. (41%). • Four in ten Americans (40%) say they have personally experienced the effects of global warming, six in ten (60%) say they have not.	2
"Credit: Getty You know it&apos;s hot out there when even the soil is hyperventilating. According to a new study published yesterday (Aug. 1) in the journal Nature, there&apos;s about twice as much carbon dioxide (CO2) stored in Earth&apos;s soil as there is floating around the atmosphere, and for the last few decades, that underground greenhouse gas has been leaking out at a significantly increased rate. The rate of CO2 released from Earth&apos;s soil has increased globally by about 1.2 percent in just 25 years. ""We&apos;re talking about a huge quantity of carbon,"" study co-author Vanessa Bailey, a soil scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state, said in a statement. ""Microbes exert an outsize influence on the world that is very hard to measure on such a large scale."""	0
Chillin' at the ice hotel As serious scientists pull back from the alarmist predictions of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and from the extreme policy pronouncements of left-wing lobby groups, the complex reality of climate is starting to emerge. AFP reports today, “Global warming rate less than feared: study”: High levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may have less of an impact on the rate of global warming than feared, a study said Thursday. Global warming is real. But the more severe estimates, such as those put forth by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, are unlikely, the researchers found in their study published in the journal Science…. Schmittner noted that many previous studies only looked at periods spanning from 1850 to today, thus not taking into account a fully integrated paleoclimate date on a global scale.	0
The state’s poverty also intensifies its aching need for improved mass transit. Huge spending cuts at the federal or state level, never mind both, are putting the state’s populace at greater risk. Fossil fuel extraction may be less an economic boon than a massive liability. Louisiana, with its oil refineries and offshore rigs, has the third-worst poverty rate in the nation—and that is sadly typical of fossil-fuel-heavy states. West Virginia and Kentucky, for example, are among the top three states for coal production and among among the 10 poorest states overall.	0
Sixty-nine percent of Fortune 500 companies reported more demand for “low carbon” products this year, according to the nonprofit Carbon Disclosure Project. And some of the country’s largest pension funds, including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and New York State’s retirement fund, have begun tilting away from fossil fuels. Over the long term, fossil fuels are a losing bet. Some experts told me that the historic accord on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions reached in Paris last year was a turning point in how investors think about climate change. The United States and China, the world’s two largest emitters, ratified it in September.	1
Today, China is uses three times the coal of the U.S. and is now the top global emitter. If California is able to achieve their 2020 target of 427 million tons of CO2 equivalent, it will be less than a 0.4% change in world emissions. Man-made carbon dioxide emissions do not drive global temperatures. No wonder Prop 23 opponents have abandoned arguments about stopping climate change.

I spend time with the conservationists there so that I understand their environmental programs,” she said. In addition to education and action, the travel industry is devising ways to become resilient to changing climates and along the way, is even discovering new tourism opportunities. Global warming had made traveling to Botswana in October, normally a pleasant time to visit temperature-wise, more challenging because of uncomfortably hot weather. Five years ago, the temperatures hovered in the high 80s to low 90s whereas last year, they exceeded 95 degrees. At the same time, the normally rainy month of April has seen less rain the last few years and has become an attractive time to visit.	0
However, there is a much larger and more important group – the undecided people who are genuinely trying to understand what’s happening to our climate. For those people, it’s imperative that they’re made aware of the scientific realities of what’s happening to our climate. Ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate. With all the distracting attacks on climate scientists, these scientific realities are getting drowned out in all the noise. So what I’m trying to do is get that information back in front of the public.	0
However, the last year to see global temperatures hit a record low was 1911, and the most recent year that fell below the 20th-century average was 1976.” Our response: As Paul Homewood notes, La Niña hasn’t even started properly yet – so we can expect to see a lot more cold to come. The reality is that we have just gone through arguably the strongest El Nino for a century or more, and yet atmospheric temperatures have barely peaked above 1998. Global temperatures drop further still. One more thing. At the bottom of the Weather.com polemic there’s a picture of the Arapahoe glacier — which is apparently supposed to show how much it has retreated as a result of late twentieth century global warming.	1
Liberal environmentalist non-profits are urging people to eat organic, consume less meat, and consider the carbon footprint of their Thanksgiving feast. The Center for Food Safety cites University of Manchester researchers’ claim that a turkey and all-the-trimmings meal for eight people produces 44 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. And the life of the bird at the center of the table contributes about 60 percent of that planet-warming gas.	1
One scientist who recently published a study that found that the IPCC predictions were very accurate argues that it is likely wrong. “The IPCC graph you refer to is just a draft version which still has a number of problems that will be ironed out,” Potsdam University physics professor Stefan Rahmstorf told FoxNews.com. The chart does not mean that global warming is a hoax. “The IPCC&apos;s claim is that they are 90 percent sure that humans have &apos;contributed to&apos; the observed warming. Hell, even I would agree with that innocuous statement.” But he says it does indicate that greenhouse gases are having less of an affect on climate than the IPCC thought.	1
2) Since causal links matter — see our third point of agreement above — we also need to be consistent in what it means: no causality, no rebound. Or in other words: economic growth and improved technology are clear drivers of increased energy demand, but let’s not confound these with energy efficiency improvements and rebound. Global energy demand is going to increase over time. (And yes, what causes economic growth is one of the most important — and most vexing — questions in economics.) If one cannot establish causality, it makes little sense to say that those projections are incorrect because of the rebound from energy efficiency improvements.	1
He also worked at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, looking at the climate system 25 years ago, before it became a hot political issue. The dangers of carbon dioxide, he believes, have been much overrated. The non-climatic effects of carbon dioxide as a sustainer of wildlife and crop plants are enormously beneficial, that the possibly harmful climatic effects of carbon dioxide have been greatly exaggerated, and that the benefits clearly outweigh the possible damage. I consider myself an unprejudiced person and to me these facts are obvious. But the same facts are not obvious to the majority of scientists and politicians who consider carbon dioxide to be evil and dangerous.	2
Well, ever since the scientists who believe the theory that you and I caused the world to warm have convinced huge numbers of us that we are, in fact, guilty. We have accepted our guilt on faith – faith in science. Burning fossil fuels emits CO2, a greenhouse gas, making the world heat up like a greenhouse sitting in the sun. Since we the voters have accepted our guilt, our democratically elected governments have too – and when governments see guilt, they see crime. Greenhouse Warming (GW) is an apocalyptic theory: GW scientists prophesy that the whole world will be devastated if we don’t stop burning fossil fuels immediately (if not sooner, since some say it’s too late and the world is already doomed).	0
Exxon Mobil, once the leading architect of the climate denial network, abruptly quit the Koch-backed American Legislative Exchange Council this month after a disagreement over an Environmental Protection Agency policy affirming the science behind climate change. BP and Royal Dutch Shell had already left the conservative policy group. The fossil fuel industry spent nearly 18 percent of all climate lobbying dollars during the period examined. In a statement, spokesman Reid Porter said the industry “also invests more in the development and deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies.” The Sierra Club, which made up part of the 2.3 percent sliver of climate lobbying dollars that came from environmental groups, blamed “the unlimited money fossil fuel polluters have poured into our political system” for making “the debate on the climate crisis in the United States … radically different than in every other country on earth.” To try to counter that disparity in lobbying dollars, legislative director Melinda Pierce said the nonprofit mobilizes “more than three million members and supporters.” Brulle suggested that climate advocates could exploit differences between industry sectors that have historically opposed climate legislation as a way to disrupt their lobbying power. Utilities that generate a larger portion of energy from natural gas or renewable power were more likely to lobby in favor of climate legislation, he said, than their coal-powered competitors.	1
There are no genetic tests that can unambiguously determine gender, or even sex.” The plan “has no foundation in science and would undo decades of progress on understanding sex… and gender,” argued an editorial in the prestigious journal Nature. Climate denial as foreign policy. Global warming is a Chinese hoax. Now that he’s in the White House, he has the benefit of overseeing some of the world’s most brilliant scientists. It hasn’t helped.	2

Only a strong West could afford to set them aside. July 4, 10:31 a.m. | Updated | Mick has added more reflections on his blog, including this thought: The specific proposal I made in this particular essay is that the current oil-and-gas boom in the US and Canada will make the West stronger in the short term, and that this is a good thing, even though it will add climate emissions. We need to more or less immediately stop using or drastically curtail fossil fuels. I also make some admittedly vague proposals for using the proceeds of the oil boom in Keynesian fashion to buy useful renewable energy and energy efficiency capital, to help maintain that geopolitical strength in the long term. But the main thing is economic strength.	0
Credit: NASA/Jeremy Harbeck Antarctica has lost 3 trillion tons of ice in the past 25 years, and that ice loss has accelerated rapidly over the last five years. In a new study, the most comprehensive to date of the continent&apos;s icy status, an international group of 84 researchers analyzed data from multiple satellite surveys, from 1992 to 2017. Antarctica is currently losing ice about three times faster than it did until 2012, climbing to a rate of more than 241 billion tons (219 billion metric tons) per year. Total ice loss during the 25-year period contributed to sea level rise of about 0.3 inches (around 8 millimeters), approximately 40 percent of which — about 0.1 inches (3 mm) — happened in the past five years. [In Photos: Antarctica&apos;s Larsen C Ice Shelf Through Time] Millimeters of sea level rise may not sound like much, but previous surveys suggested that Antarctica&apos;s massive ice sheets likely wouldn&apos;t be affected by climate change at all.	1
Why has wealth shifted the way it has? 2. We are all familiar with the general outlines of globalization. Yet curiously, this lenient Cold War-era trade strategy persisted even after the end of the Cold War. Indeed, in the 1990s, free trade took on a life of its own; it was no longer seen as a means to an end — the end being to firm up our alliances — but rather, as an end in itself.	1
Global warming is a myth. The poll also found that those who believed in global warming remained roughly the same, but those who were undecided dropped six percentage points, leading to the conclusion that many of those who were once vacillating now disbelieve global warming. Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, fretted, “People who prior said don’t know are increasingly saying they don’t believe it.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the chief purveyor of global warming as fact, released a report in September 2013 asserting that it is “extremely likely” that human emissions of greenhouse gases are causing global warming.	2
Chris Christie, Governor of New Jersey In the middle of his own bid for the presidential nomination, the New Jersey governor referred to Trump as a “carnival barker,” a “13-year-old,” and “thin-skinned.” Then Christie endorsed him. He’s had a similar approach to climate change. No use in denying global warming exists. Newt Gingrich, Former Speaker of the House Gingrich used to think Congress should address climate change—as seen in the bizarre commercial with Nancy Pelosi embedded below. But apparently he changed his mind sometime after 2008.	0
"""Ice-sheet models link Pine Island glacier absence to full WAIS collapse into ice caps on mountains,"" the study&apos;s abstract read. ""Our record thus provides the first direct indication of a much smaller LIG WAIS, providing paleo-context for the susceptibility of the WAIS to collapse."" As the Antarctic ice sheet continues to melt away, we expect multi-meter sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries. Another recent study also shed light on the startling rise in sea-levels and the effects climate change is having on the planet. The study said the amount of energy that has been put into the Earth&apos;s oceans over the past 150 years is the equivalent of an atomic bomb explosion every second for 150 years."	0
"And we need to start doing that now, the researchers said. If society actually did that, we&apos;d have a 64 percent chance of limiting the average global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels, said study lead researcher Christopher Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds, in England. We could ramp down all of the fossil-fuel-emitting infrastructure that we have, all of the way until it reaches the end of its life. ""And then we&apos;d replace it with something [that emits] zero carbon."" However, this plan — while scientifically sound — is likely a pie-in-the-sky idea that won&apos;t happen anytime soon, said Donald Wuebbles, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who wasn&apos;t involved with the research."	1
The participants included 31 journalists from 26 developing countries, whose backgrounds and stories can be explored here, along with 10 journalists from the United States. (The activities and journalists’ travel costs, including mine, were underwritten by the Earth Journalism Network of Internews, a nonprofit group seeking to foster unfettered, credible and innovative media around the world. There is no “global warming” story. This opaque term encompasses a dizzying range of stories and issues, from the basic science pointing to a rising human influence on Earth’s climate system to the tougher question of how much warming is too much, to the global and regional debates about the mix of policies that offers the smoothest human path on a crowding planet. We explored how countries’ postures in talks were as often as not about reliance on fossil fuels, economic competitiveness or domestic politics as targets and timetables for emissions or financial help for vulnerable communities.	2
Reinhart, 2017 Our results permit to conclude that CO2 is a very weak greenhouse gas and cannot be accepted as the main driver of climate change Climate Models are Unreliable/The Pause is Real Blackall, 2017 The science publication Nature Climate Change this year published a study demonstrating Earth this century warmed substantially less than computer-generated climate models predict. Unfortunately for public knowledge, such findings don’t appear in the news. The Arctic sea ice cover is rapidly retreating while the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily expanding. State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. Ahlström et al., 2017 We conclude that climate bias-induced uncertainties must be decreased to make accurate coupled atmosphere-carbon cycle projections.	1
"“2018 is yet again an extremely warm year on top of a long-term global warming trend,” said GISS Director Gavin Schmidt in the statement. CLIMATE CHANGE COULD CAUSE &apos;SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE&apos; IN EXTREME STORMS, NASA SAYS Collectively, the past five years are ""the warmest years in the modern record,"" NASA added. Since the 1880s, the global temperature has risen approximately 2 degrees Fahrenheit. That&apos;s largely due to ""increased emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases caused by human activities,"" Schmidt said. NASA also said that since weather dynamics are often regional, not every region would experience a similar amount of warming."	1
It is of retirement age and needs to be put in the retirement home,” Ms. Figueres said. Jim Lakely, a spokesman for the Heartland Institute, said he hoped United Nations climate delegates would also hear his group’s message. Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is not the driver of global warming. “So there is no moral case for restricting the use of fossil fuels, especially because that is vital to raising the quality and length of life of the world’s poorest people.” Diplomats from other countries said they were glad to see governors, mayors and other Americans still committed to the Paris agreement making their presence felt. But they also said they weren’t sure which voice of American policy they should believe.	2
The relative inaccuracy of the IPCC projections increased with longer (multi-decadal) horizons. Even forecasts of natural global cooling at a rate of 1 ºC per century were much more accurate over long periods than the IPCC’s projections of dangerous man-made global warming. Global temperatures had reached a dangerous “tipping point,” with extreme warming imminent and unavoidable. Professor Scott Armstrong challenged Mr. Gore to a ten-year bet based on the Green-Armstrong-Soon (2009)) scientific no-change forecast of global mean temperatures. Mr. Gore declined the bet, but theclimatebet.com website keeps track of how the bet would have turned out.	0
And while atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations have risen from about 360 to 400 parts per million over the last 18 years (i.e. by 10 percent, which in turn represents more than 30 percent of all human emissions since 1850), the global air temperature, more accurately measured by satellite sensors, shows no increase and certainly no sign of accelerating. Carbon dioxide emissions provide the environmentally vital services of greening the planet and assuring our food supply. What causes both the widespread alarmism and the public ignorance of the beneficial effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide? Scientists remaining silent.	2
The White House this afternoon issued a muted summary of the meeting President Obama held with 23 senators aiming to forge consensus on energy legislation that would also constrain greenhouse gases. (The summary is appended below.) In the long run, the costs from raising the price of fossil-fueled electricity and other sources of energy could be modest. Public support for accepting the costs attending an accelerated shift away from the fuels of convenience, particularly coal, remains weak, at best. This leaves the momentum with the stasists — those lawmakers and constituencies who, either through a profit motive or skepticism of climate risks or simple fear of change — see no need for new energy norms.	1
Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt filed a failed lawsuit as attorney general to overturn the regulation. He filed another lawsuit against the EPA regional haze rule, which requires state plans to clear the air around national parks. Carbon pollution harms human health and is therefore subject to the Clean Air Act. In a CNN interview just hours before Trump’s speech Tuesday, Pruitt revealed just how desperate Republicans sometimes are to avoid talking to the public about how their plans would impact air and water. CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Pruit if he would be comfortable with cutting the EPA’s $8 billion budget by 25 percent, the amount that’s been floated by anonymous administration sources.	1
It characterizes I-1631 as an “expensive and unaccountable” spending measure. “No, ‘big polluters’ won’t bear these costs,” the board writes. We should work for a national carbon tax instead.

An incredibly intricate plotTwitter This story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Two years after President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that their countries would work together to combat climate change, Republicans and conservatives in the United States continue to cite China’s rising carbon emissions as a reason not to bother cutting our own. Limiting our carbon pollution is pointless because of China’s supposedly growing coal dependency. “Every time we shut down a coal plant in the US, China builds 10,” Moore told E&E News. “So how does that reduce global warming?” Not only is Moore’s statement simply untrue, but the broader conservative theory behind it is badly outdated.	2
In April, the Western States Petroleum Association launched “No on 1631,” a political action committee that has attracted millions of dollars from industry. As of September, opponents had raised more than $16 million, outpacing the initiative’s sponsors. Fossil fuel companies should pay a carbon tax. And Initiative 1631’s backers think public health argu­ments will resonate with voters. In his annual state address, Gov.	1
I’d say fifty/fifty odds, at best. [See the update below including a sea-ice scientist’s take on such wagers.] Profound changes are well under way that virtually guarantee the Arctic described in history books. There will be problems and opportunities, as I and other Times reporters chronicled in detail in our 2005 series “The Big Melt” and as I wrote in my book, “The North Pole Was Here.” But is this a situation that is appropriately described as a “death spiral”? Not by my standards.	1
One may also wonder how no climate scientist was able to predict Hurricane Harvey and yet once it happens they know “almost certainly” that it was aggravated by “human-caused warming.” Fortunately, there are other—more modest—climate scientists who are willing to acknowledge just how much science cannot tell us about climate. Dr. Duane Thresher, who has a PhD in climate science from Columbia and NASA GISS, told Breitbart News that attributing specific climatic events to global warming is simply dishonest. It is a fundamental fact, although increasingly ignored, that no single climate event or location can be attributed to global warming. “There is simply no valid way to prove a connection and correlation is not causation.” According to Thresher, relying on simple correlation leads to absurd conclusions like the following: “As global warming has supposedly been occurring, the average human lifespan has significantly increased. Therefore, global warming causes increased human lifespans,” he said.	2
The goal of the conference is to come up with a “rulebook” to enforce the Paris agreement, even as some recent reports claim that the agreement does not go far enough, according to AFP. “Just last week, the UN’s environment programme said the voluntary national contributions agreed in Paris would have to triple if the world was to cap global warming below 2C,” AFP reported. While the data are clear, a global political consensus over how to tackle climate change remains elusive. But President Donald Trump decided in June to withdraw the United States from the agreement and reiterated his opposition to it because of the fiscal and other harm it would cause the United States at the recent G20 summit in Argentina. “Katowice (Poland) may show us if there will be any domino effect,” from the U.S. withdrawal, Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the Paris agreement, said in the AFP report.	1
Here’s another report from the New York Times, this one published on May 21, 1975. In this news story, reporter Walter Sullivan noted many scientists believed global cooling was “inevitable,” but he also said there were numerous researchers predicting massive, catastrophic global warming within the next century. A new ice age is on the way. And there are those who say that such pollution may actually head off an ice age. Sooner or later a major cooling of the climate is widely considered inevitable.	1
The IEA estimates that production could reach 11.1 million barrels per day by 2020, almost entirely because of increases in the production of shale oil, which is extracted using the same horizontal drilling and fracking techniques that have flooded the US with cheap natural gas. Energy researcher Vaclav Smil suggests in The American that these developments should mean the end of “peak oil” anxieties: Obviously, there will come a time when global oil extraction will reach its peak, but even that point may be of little practical interest as it could be followed by a prolonged, gentle decline or by an extended output plateau at a somewhat lower level than peak production. We’ve increased spending on oil production by tremendous amounts only to see global oil production edge up a bit. Older, cheaper oil fields are declining, and their oil is being replaced by crude from far more expensive sources. Nelder made his numerical case to the Washington Post like this: In 2005, we reached 73 million barrels per day.	1
"The IPCC, an international body assessing climate science, projected that shifting the energy system from fossil fuels to zero- or low-carbon sources including wind and solar power would reduce consumption growth by about 0.06 percentage points per year, adding that that didn&apos;t take into account the economic benefits of reduced climate change. ""The loss in consumption is relatively modest,"" Pachauri said. The shift would entail a near-quadrupling of low-carbon energy — which in the panel&apos;s projections included renewable sources as well as nuclear power and fossil fuel-fired plants equipped with technologies to capture some of the emissions. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called it a global economic opportunity. ""So many of the technologies that will help us fight climate change are far cheaper, more readily available, and better performing than they were when the last IPCC assessment was released less than a decade ago,"" Kerry said."	1
Scientists have concluded that the sheer destructive force of Superstorm Sandy owed partially to climate change—and that climate change will probably contribute to a repeat disaster in the future. As Princeton University’s Michael Oppenheimer told the Associated Press, climate-change-triggered sea level rise caused flooding to reach 50,000 more people than it would have otherwise. By the year 2100, floods like the ones caused by Sandy could become 1-in-20-year events. And yet Congress hasn’t considered any serious climate change legislation since the storm. The Obama administration has introduced major new carbon emissions regulations, but industry interests and Republican allies have vowed to oppose them.	0
“America is addicted to oil,” President George W. Bush typically declared in his 2006 State of the Union address (and he was hardly the first president to do so). Such statements have often been accompanied in the media by cartoons of Uncle Sam as a junkie, desperately injecting his next petroleum “fix.” But few analysts have carried the analogy further, exploring the ways our growing dependence on oil has generated increasingly erratic and self-destructive behavior. Addiction to fossil fuels has reached a point at which we should expect the judgment of senior leaders to become impaired, as seems to be happening. The most persuasive evidence that fossil fuel addiction has reached a critical stage may be found in official US data on carbon dioxide emissions. The world is now emitting one and a half times as much CO2 as it did in 1988, when James Hansen, then director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, warned Congress that the planet was getting warmer as a result of the “greenhouse effect,” and that human activity—largely in the form of carbon emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels—was almost certainly the cause.	0
Any other result would have been shocking. More importantly, let’s drill down into that all important phrase “on record.” Global temperatures in 2009 are the highest on record only if: 1) the “record” starts in the mid nineteenth century, when semi-reliable temperature records first come into play, or 2) the “record” goes back millennia but includes only that portion of the secondary indicators (aka: proxy data), like tree rings and ice cores, that organizations like the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (CRU) and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would like us to consider. 150 years or so of data is far too little to be of any significance when it comes to a system as dynamic and complex as global climate. One can not discern a trend based on a snapshot. The problem with the second approach is a little more complex.	2
The result is that the subsidies drastically reduce the risk of annual operations—and of expansion. But this risk reduction brings risks of its own. Crop insurance has played a role in encouraging farmers to expand row crops onto marginal land like wetlands or prairie, which exacerbates vulnerability to erosion, floods, and drought. And yet the crop insurance program provides no formal incentive for water conservation or soil preservation, key elements in climate adaptation. On their own a few farmers around here experiment with traditional conservation practices, including cover crops.	1
In coral reefs, both pH and temperatures are climbing. “Our paper’s showing that pH is already well beyond the historical threshold,” coauthor Abby Frazier told reporters Tuesday. There is no major push to curb carbon emissions in the coming years. The study also predicted a second set of temperatures for an alternate future, in which there’s what lead researcher Camilo Mora calls a “strong and concerted” effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That scenario would result in there being 538 parts per million of carbon in the atmosphere in 2100, which is significantly lower than the 936 ppm that the researchers estimate will be in the atmosphere without that effort.	1
The atmospheric chemists from France and Germany, however, could now show that isoprene could also be formed without biological sources in surface film of the oceans by sunlight and so explain the large discrepancy between field measurements and models. The new identified photochemical reaction is therefore important to improve the climate models. The oceans not only take up heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A key role is played by the so-called surface microlayer (SML), especially at low wind speed.

Unsatisfied that people pay less and less attention to their scam, that satellite data are hardcore “deniers” and that many 2015 studies show how a giant H bomb 150 million km from the Earth influence the climate (instead of CO2), a group of some 20 scientists ask President Barack Obama to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (the law designed to fight the mafia) against the infidels of the Green Church. They quickly backed down and withdrew their letter when they saw this action backfire … forgetting that the Internet keeps things from falling in the “memory hole.” Photo credit: Shutterstock So the said letter is the rehashing of the catastrophic, man-made climate hysteria upon which we must promptly act, despite an abysmal track record of climate predictions. The global warming narrative is a religion. Real science is always open for new ideas as long as they respect the scientific method – if facts support a hypothesis and then bring a conclusion. This is why science (generally) pays no attention to theories like creationism or most “alternative” medicine: they have no scientific basis and they have never been published in peer-reviewed journals.	2
In other parts of the Midwest, the pollen season has gotten longer by anywhere from 11 days to 20 days. And all this will come with a hefty cost, the report says. Flooding alone may cost $325 billion by the year 2100 in one of the worst-case scenarios, with $130 billion of that in Florida. Already the droughts and heat waves of 2011 and 2012 added about $10 billion to farm costs, the report says. Billion-dollar weather disasters have hit everywhere across the nation, but have hit Texas, Oklahoma and the Southeast most often, the report says.	1
An average of 17.5 inches fell over a region of 14,000 square miles. In Harvey, 25.6 inches fell over that same area. Climate change significantly increased the amount of rain that flooded Houston. While the advance attribution for Florence was unusual, since it was looking at predicted forecasts rather than the actual event, it seems to fit in that same context. The forecast was part of an effort to answer the questions that people most want to know, says Kevin Reed, an atmospheric scientist at Stony Brook University in New York and a coauthor of the report.	0
"Nevertheless, based on the evidence presented here so far, the inference is simple and unavoidable: Global warming upped Sandy’s damage, and did so substantially. Not that Sandy wouldn’t have been very bad anyway—it would have—but that it was worse than it would otherwise have been.

This event may already be comparable to, or even exceed, both the speed and intensity of the Permian mass extinction. The difference being that ours is human caused, isn’t going to take 80,000 years, has so far lasted just a few centuries, and is now gaining speed in a non-linear fashion. On top of the vast quantities of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels that continue to enter the atmosphere in record amounts yearly. Some scientists fear that the situation is already so serious and so many self-reinforcing feedback loops are already in play that we are in the process of causing our own extinction. Worse yet, some are convinced that it could happen far more quickly than generally believed possible—even in the course of just the next few decades.	1
"The United Nations calculated in an earlier report that without the pact, by 2030 there would have been an extra 2 million skin cancer cases a year around the world. Paradoxically, heat-trapping greenhouse gases — considered the major cause of global warming — are also helping to rebuild the ozone layer, Newman said. Rising levels of carbon dioxide and other gases cool the upper stratosphere, and the cooler air increases the amount of ozone. And in another worrisome trend, the chemicals that replaced CFCs contribute to global warming and are on the rise, said MIT atmospheric scientist Susan Solomon. At the moment, they don&apos;t make much of a dent, but they are expected to increase dramatically by 2050 and make ""a big contribution"" to global warming."	1
"This is not controversial in mainstream science, everybody."" (Kena Betancur/Getty Images) Nye added that he ""encourages"" everyone to look at the facts. The polar ice caps would melt completely by the mid-2010's causing the sea levels to rise by meters, which would then put low-lying coastal areas across the world under water. None of these things ever happened. In fact, ocean waters have not warmed on an overall average basis, despite claims made by people like Nye and former Vice President Al Gore."	0
But with sea levels rising along the East Coast—a natural phenomenon accelerated by climate change—scientists project that in our lifetimes what was once considered a 100-year flood will happen every 3 to 20 years. And truly catastrophic storms will do damage unimaginable today. If you have, say, five feet of sea level rise, it’s going to be much more devastating. And that spells trouble: 50 percent of the nation’s shorelines, 11,200 miles in all, are highly vulnerable to sea level rise, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And the problem isn’t so much that the surf laps a few inches higher: It’s what happens to all that extra water during a storm.	0
Over 100 of these papers, for instance, examine the substantial solar influence on climate and weather, such as temperature variations and precipitation patterns. The second position questions the allegedly “unprecedented” nature of modern climate phenomena such as warming, sea levels, glacier and sea ice retreat, and hurricane and drought intensities. These events fall within the range of natural variability, while 38 found an absence of significant anthropogenic causality in rising sea levels. The third position casts doubt upon the efficacy and reliability of computer climate models for projecting future climate states, suggesting that such predictions are “little more than speculation” given the enormous uncertainty and margins of error in a non-linear climate system with nearly infinite variables. Twenty-eight of the articles in question examined climate model unreliability, including factual errors and the influence of biases, while an additional 12 found no net global warming during the 20th/21st century.	1
It shook me bad. And I’m not the only one. A lot of Americans are growing far more concerned about climate change, precisely because they’re drawing the links between freaky weather, a climate kicked off-kilter by a fossil-fuel guzzling civilization, and their own lives. After a year with a record number of multi-billion dollar weather disasters, seven in ten Americans now believe that “global warming is affecting the weather.” No less striking, 35 percent of the respondents reported that extreme weather had affected them personally in 2011. As Yale’s Anthony Laiserowitz told the New York Times, “People are starting to connect the dots.” Which is what we must do.	0
There is a clear connection between rising global temperatures and type-2 diabetes. According to the report, titled “Diabetes incidence and glucose intolerance prevalence increase with higher outdoor temperature,” for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, there is an age-adjusted diabetes incidence increase of 0.314 per 1,000 people. The report’s authors state in their conclusion, “Our findings indicate that the diabetes incidence rate in the USA and prevalence of glucose intolerance worldwide increase with higher outdoor temperature.” In a report published by the Huffington Post, one of the co-authors of the studies reportedly said the connection may be caused by higher temperatures’ effect on brown fat or climate-related links between exercise patterns, diets and higher temperatures.	1
Warming temperatures in Pacific Ocean waters off the coast of North America over the past century closely follow natural changes in the wind, not the increases in greenhouse gases related to global warming. (AP Photo/Jeff Barnard, File) (AP Photo/Jeff Barnard, File) A new study released Monday found that warming temperatures in Pacific Ocean waters off the coast of North America over the past century closely followed natural changes in the wind, not increases in greenhouse gases related to global warming. The study compared ocean surface temperatures from 1900 to 2012 to surface air pressure, a stand-in for wind measurements, and found a close match.	2
It was planning to conduct the third leg of its research by sending 40 scientists from five Canadian universities out into the Bay on the Canadian Research Icebreaker CCGS Amundsen to study “contributions of climate change and regulation on the Hudson Bay system.” But it had to be cancelled because the scientists’ icebreaker was required by the Canadian Coast Guard for a rather more urgent purpose – rescuing fishing boats and supply ships which had got stuck in the “unprecedented ice conditions”. “It became clear to me very quickly that these weren’t just heavy ice conditions, these were unprecedented ice conditions,” Dr. David Barber, the lead scientist on the study, told VICE. Global warming is a major problem and deserving of our urgent attention. He told Vice: “It was clear it was from the Arctic, I just needed to be among the ice to see it,” said Dr. Barber. “What was also clear to me was that climate change has caused this event to happen.” [Don’t you just love that “I just needed to be among the ice”?	0
“Temperature changes are expected to alter allergy seasons to begin earlier and last longer and the distribution of allergenic plant varieties to change over time.” The EPA is hardly alone in saying that climate change could make allergy season more hellish. A 2010 report by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences warns, “There is also a possibility that certain aeroallergens may become more allergenic as temperatures and CO2 concentrations increase.” (Besides exacerbating the pollen count, climate change is linked in some regions to a rise in ozone, fine particles, and dust—all of which can cause or worsen respiratory diseases, the report found.) The weeds that produce many allergens have adapted the best to an atmosphere that is chock-full of carbon dioxide. Pollen from ragweed, for instance, which peaks in the summer and is one of the most common triggers for allergies, has exploded as the climate has warmed. From 1995 to 2011, according to the EPA, the ragweed allergy season grew up to 24 days longer in regions across the Midwest:	1
The word not used in this cautious, conservative report is mass famine, which is very bad for your stocks. And infinitely worse for the people who are starving. Europe’s financial losses related to flooding, which now total about 4.9 billion euros a year, could increase almost 380% to 23.5 billion euros by 2050. Studies about the future impact of climate change are one thing that’s not in short supply. You can focus on the oceans and fisheries, on polar ice, on species, on food supplies, floods, fires, hurricanes, and typhoons–and in the language of the market, indicators are that catastrophe is going way, way up.	1
Maxfield then went on to test a variety of climate messages—and the upshot, he says, is that “if you feel strongly about climate change, there is a way to talk about it that voters will understand and appreciate”—especially if candidates focus on recent extreme weather. “I was surprised at the strength of that, and the extent to which voters had begun to recognize the severe weather, and experience it,” Maxfield says. Climate scientists themselves are increasingly outspoken about explaining that global warming is shifting the odds in favor of more heat waves, severe storms, and other weather extremes. Another set of messages Maxfield tested involve oil companies, which people perceive as having too much power. “They know that oil companies command undue influence” and “have rigged the system in many ways,” says Maxfield.	1
The world is now emitting one and a half times as much CO2 as it did in 1988, when James Hansen, then director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, warned Congress that the planet was getting warmer as a result of the “greenhouse effect,” and that human activity—largely in the form of carbon emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels—was almost certainly the cause. If a reasonable concern over the fate of the planet were stronger than our reliance on fossil fuels, we would expect to see, if not a reduction in carbon emissions, then a decline at least in the rate of increase of emissions over time. Global emissions will continue to rise at a torrid pace over the next quarter century, reaching 45.5 billion metric tons in 2040—more than double the amount recorded in 1998 and enough, in the view of most scientists, to turn our planet into a living hell. Though seldom recognized as such, this is the definition of addiction-induced self-destruction, writ large. For many of us, the addiction to petroleum is embedded in our everyday lives in ways over which we exercise limited control.	0
"CIER predicts that climate change will hit the Texas Gulf Coast harder than other parts of the country as a result of its population growth and its natural resource-intensive economy. Yet despite these threats, Perry has done worse than nothing to tackle the climate problem. I’ve heard Al Gore talk about global warming so much that I’m starting to think that his mouth is the leading source of all that supposedly deadly carbon dioxide. But Texas environmentalists say that native sons such as T. Boone Pickens and the state’s own burgeoning wind power industry have given Perry some room to occupy the middle ground on climate issues. The problem is that Perry’s stuck in the past, says Ken Kramer, the head of the Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter: “The long term interests of the state of Texas and its people and its economy are basically being betrayed by the governor.” window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={""beacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""licenseKey"":""949ceaf672"",""applicationID"":""42428067"",""transactionName"":""MQZWYhAFXhdYAUBfWwhMdVUWDV8KFhFdWFMTD1VE"",""queueTime"":0,""applicationTime"":206,""atts"":""HUFBFFgfTUgbAxYMTxse"",""errorBeacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""agent"":""""}"	2
"The international Paris accord climate agreement, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in June, set a goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. ""The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal,"" King noted. Today the world's leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear — that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy. ""Unfortunately, the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past,"" Gore added. ""The administration is in direct conflict with American businesses, states, cities and citizens leading the transformation."""	0
He related a lengthy history of first-hand accounts in Europe of rising and falling temperatures; long periods, sometimes as long as a decade or more, of extreme heat or cold; and the all-too-familiar-sounding reports of melting glaciers, dying crops, and strange weather. Examining more than 1,000 years of stories from across Europe, the author concluded climate change and natural variability were nothing to be too excited or too worried about. Glaciers and sea ice may have been melting, but eventually Earth would move into an intense cooling pattern again. It was only a matter of time. What’s most striking about the article isn’t that there were reports of shrinking sea ice or rising global temperature; it’s that with far less technology than what’s available to our modern scientists, at least some early 19th century climate researchers were able to look beyond the climate directly in front of them, rightly choosing to see climate on a much larger and more informative scale.	2
"We can further know that the Sun -- which is big enough to eat a million Earths, and hot enough to make you burst into flames from millions of miles away -- really calls the shots in our solar system. If we're searching for ""global warming"" culprits, we might want to look at that 27,000,000 degree ball of gas in the sky. If human CO2 emissions are a primary driver of global temperatures, it wouldn't make sense for temperatures to drop or stay stagnate while humanity only continues to increase its CO2 output. But that's exactly what's happened. I can know that, and I can know that something doesn't make sense here."	2
Authors said that wealthier individuals could benefit more from having smaller refrigerators, while those less well off could save more energy than wealthier individuals by buying smaller TVs. Peter Lilley, a Conservative member of the Commons Energy and Climate Change committee, is quoted in the Telegraph as saying: “The survey exposes the hypocrisy of many who claim to be ‘green’: the greater the concern people express about global warming the less they do to reduce their energy usage.” Last month, it was revealed that Greenpeace’s international director, Pascal Husting, commuted between his home in Luxembourg and work in Amsterdam twice a month by plane. The carbon footprint generated would be equivalent to leaving a low-energy light bulb switched on for 220 years, or the average household energy consumption for two years.	1
Its authors are bringing nothing to the party other than the fact that, being medical professors, they sound vaguely like the kind of scientifically rigorous, dispassionate, experty authorities you can trust to tell you like it is; and, as even they themselves admit, it has been designed to influence the political agenda in the runup to this December’s UN conference in Paris. If you want to appreciate just how hysterically over-the-top the report’s authors are, here’s a taste of one of them, speaking to the BBC. The threat to human health from climate change is so great that it could undermine the last 50 years of gains in developments in global health. Putting that bluntly, you’re suggesting that more people will die younger. Hugh Montgomery: Absolutely, and we’re not talking about small numbers, either.	0

A new Science Advances study modeled the impact of tsunamis based on sea level increases, and discovered worrying results."	0
If solar prices do continue to fall quickly, the technology will come ever closer to its moment of glory: (hazily defined, so-called) grid parity. This is when solar can really be called “cheap”—grid parity comes when solar is less expensive than fossil fuels, even without subsidies. Fossil fuels receive several types of subsidies. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard at the Telegraph describes the steady march towards this tipping point: The US Energy Department expects the cost of solar power to fall by 75pc between 2010 and 2020. By then average costs will have dropped to the $1 per watt for big solar farms, $1.25 for offices and $1.50 for homes, achieving the Holy Grail of grid parity with new coal and gas plants without further need for subsidies…The race is on: somebody, somewhere, is soon going to deliver grid parity with a clarity that silences all critics.	1
Arctic sea ice on September 13, 2013, as measured by satellite microwave sensors and arrayed on NASA’s cloudless Blue Marble satellite imagery.NASA This story first appeared on the Atlantic website and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Former US vice president Al Gore delivers a speech before a screening of the film he helped make of his best-selling global warming book 'An Inconvenient Truth', 22 June 2007 in Cannes, southern France. Gore was recently nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in drawing attention to climate change, while the film 'An Inconvenient Truth' earlier this year won an Oscar. Sea levels could rise six meters (20 feet) with the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Now, we know that the South Pole is gaining more ice than it’s losing. Also a great amount of the losing is due to underground heat.	1
That’s a disconcerting vision to come just on the heels of Sunday’s new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which predicted a nightmarish future if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t slowed soon. “The reserves are going to be able to turn into money, because they’re assuming there isn’t going to be a policy change,” said Natural Resources Defense Council Director of Climate Programs David Hawkins. No matter what happens with climate change, the economics of fossil fuel production are likely to stay favorable for the foreseeable future. The price of carbon would need to rise past $200 per metric ton by 2050 to make burning it so expensive that greenhouse gas concentrations would level off at 450 parts per million, according to the report. That’s orders of magnitude beyond the roughly $9 price that currently exists in Europe’s cap-and-trade market.	1
“Conclusion: our addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere does not appear to be increasing Earth’s temperature. Whatever is happening to Earth’s climate does not seem to be our fault.” However, he does acknowledge that climate change is happening. The sea level has been rising since the end of the last Ice Age, starting about 14,000 years ago as the continental and mountain glaciers have melted and sea water has expanded with the overall warming. The average rate has been about a foot or two a century”. The question he poses is: what to do about it?	1
And then coal has another pollution problem, and that’s carbon pollution: It’s the most carbon-intense fossil fuel. And the president invested in carbon capture and sequestration technology as part of the Recovery Act. I’m from a coal state, so I believe that if there’s going to be a future for coal it has to be one that deals with carbon pollution, with climate change. So in my opinion the problem for coal right now is entirely economic. The natural gas that this country has and is continuing to develop is cheaper right now on average.	0

Scientists concluded that there is no proof that global warming is caused by humans, and no proof that global warming will cause catastrophic issues for Earth. Also, various studies have followed the fluctuating average temperature of the earth, and a study in August 2017 reported that the average climate was actually cooler then than it was when Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work in pushing climate change awareness. The National Oceanic and Atmosphere Association fudged numbers to support the agenda of global warming. You can read the full report here. Marc Morano of Climate Depot also weighed in on the IPCC's new report, noting that climatologists have been warning that a critical tipping point has been right around the corner — since at least 1864, and time, and time, and time again from that point.	2
New York City, Boston, San Francisco, and Miami are among the U.S. cities that a group of scientists said could disappear because of rising waters caused by man-made climate change. “Residents of roughly 500 cities across the US will be faced with the same choices by the end of the century: whether to mitigate or to abandon their homes,” CNN reported on a study released on Wednesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). Scientists have been trying to get people to wake up to the dangers that lie ahead in rising seas due to climate change. “Between 165 and 180 chronically inundated communities in just the next 15 to 20 years; between 270 and 360 in roughly 40 years, depending on the pace of sea level rise; and 490 by end of century with a moderate sea level rise scenario,” Erika Spanger-Siegfried, co-author and senior climate analyst for UCS, said. “With a higher sea level rise scenario, that number rises to about 670; that’s about half of all of the oceanfront communities in the lower 48.” CNN reported that 90 U.S. communities are considered “inundated today,” mostly in Louisiana and Maryland, where allegedly seas are rising and the land is sinking.	0
America’s “Paper of Record” apparently does not want to be on the record about exactly what it was those researchers stuck in the Antarctic ice over Christmas were researching. As we all now know, thanks mainly to alternative conservative media, the stranded Australian researchers are Global Warming believers who were there to document ice melt. In a Monday story about the logistics of the rescue, the Times completely ignores the Global Warming angle. The passengers were scientists, tourists and journalists on a research trip, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition. The fact that the Times seems worried about disclosing the Global Warming angle tells you just how sketchy the science is behind this massive, left-wing Climate Change hoax.	1
Here are six of the most important ones: Most people don’t know anything about climate science, and with all that’s going on in the world, who can blame them? Instead of studying the issue for themselves, people rely on the media and the scientists the media has promoted to provide them with scientific conclusions. In other words, to the extent the public believes in the theory humans are responsible for global warming. Based on climate-alarmist scientists’ track record, the answer is clearly “no.” Over the past three decades, many climate scientists have repeatedly made a number of significant and alarming predictions about global warming, and the vast majority of the time, they’ve been wrong—really, really wrong. As Roy Spencer—who earned his Ph.D. in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin in 1981 and previously served as the senior scientist for climate studies at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center—wrote in 2014, greater than 95 percent of the climate models through 2013 “over-forecast the warming trend since 1979.” It’s common for climate alarmists to argue that global warming has caused and will continue to cause a significant increase in extreme weather events, including hurricanes, and that sea levels will eventually rise to the point that massive cities will someday be flooded and uninhabitable, but the available data say otherwise.	1
The Generation report follows the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‘s assessment of current global warming science, which set out a “carbon budget” of how much carbon dioxide we can continue to pump into the atmosphere before triggering dangerous levels of warming. By extrapolating from that, other scientists have suggested there could be as little as 30 years of burning fossil fuels before the threshold is reached. Many of the world’s remaining fossil fuel resources must be left unexploited if the climate is not to be put in danger, and prominent scientific and political leaders are increasingly calling for this to be recognized. Gore and Blood’s recommendations could take a decade to complete, the partners admit, but they insist that the first steps at least should be undertaken urgently. Blood said there were an increasing number of investors with a clear understanding of climate change, but added: “There needs to be more engagement.” Gore and Blood founded Generation Investment Management in 2004, with the aim of pushing forward low-carbon finance and promoting alternatives to the fossil fuel economy.	0
“OK we’ll accept that, but Iceland is not the world, and a good number of volcanoes that have erupted in the last century are in the tropical parts of the world where there are no glaciers on the volcanoes or magma fields, yet somehow, this writer, Jeffrey Kluger, extrapolates Iceland’s glacier melt to volcano link up to the entire world. “But, there’s a hitch. A far more likely contender for the cause of the glacier melt is the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation. Iceland is located in the north Atlantic, which has been experiencing a warm phase since about 1980. “Gee, do you think maybe, possibly, that Iceland might have more glacier melt when the AMO is warmer?” Watts asks “The authors don’t seem to be cognizant of it, preferring instead to cite the universal bogeyman “climate change”.	2
"(AP) BERLIN – The cost of keeping global warming in check is ""relatively modest,"" but only if the world acts quickly to reverse the buildup of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, the head of the U.N.&apos;s expert panel on climate change said Sunday. Such gases, mainly CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, rose on average by 2.2 percent a year in 2000-2010, driven by the use of coal in the power sector, officials said as they launched the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change&apos;s report on measures to fight global warming. Without additional measures to contain emissions, global temperatures will rise about 5 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 compared to current levels. ""The longer we delay the higher would be the cost,"" IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri told The Associated Press after the panel&apos;s weeklong session in Berlin. ""But despite that, the point I&apos;m making is that even now, the cost is not something that&apos;s going to bring about a major disruption of economic systems."	0
The culprit, he says, is climate change, and it’s not just impacting skiers and snowboarders: The $67 billion snow sport industry includes businesses near ski spots and the locals who run them, and their survival depends on robust winters. Just ask ski-area business owners from Vermont to California, who are still slogging through a major bummer of a winter this season. Global warming, unsurprisingly, is bad news for snowpack. To fight back, in 2007 Jones created Protect Our Winters, a nonprofit alliance of snow athletes that raises money and lobbies politicians to pass legislation limiting greenhouse gas emissions and supporting clean energy. This fall, Jones, along with a team of scientists and other snow athletes, traveled to Washington, DC, (where the battle over climate change is “gnarly,” he said) to meet with lawmakers from snowy states, including Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.).	0
For instance, in 1969, the New York Times reported, “Col. Bernt Balchen, polar explorer and flier [now serving with General Dynamics], is circulating a paper among polar specialists proposing that the Arctic pack ice is thinning and that the ocean at the North Pole may become an open sea within a decade or two. An ice-free Arctic Ocean would not freeze again. These dire predictions, and many more just like them, never occurred, of course, but they all have one thing in common: Environmentalists have consistently used scientific projections to justify radical, often socialistic policy changes, including carbon taxes and exchanges, incentives to limit population growth and other extreme measures that take power away from individuals and give it to an ever-growing centralized government. I believe we could be about to experience another remarkable shift in the climate change debate, although radical environmentalists’ plan to seize your rights will likely remain the same.	1
The world is on the verge of collapse because of humans’ use of fossil fuels. For example, the San Jose Mercury News (Calif.) reported on June 30, 1989: “A senior environmental official at the United Nations, Noel Brown, says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000. Coastal flooding and crop failures would create an exodus of ‘eco-refugees,’ threatening political chaos, said Brown, director of the New York office of the U.N.	0
The drought has been the result of storms shifting northward—the same conditions predicted by climate change models. Though it may also be caused by the naturally occurring La Niña weather pattern, human-induced global warming “is almost certainly making this extreme event worse,” Texas A&M climate scientist Andrew Dessler told ThinkProgress Green. Global warming could spell disaster for the state’s water supply. Population growth alone would make coping with a multi-year drought like the one Texas experienced in the 1950s “extremely difficult,” he writes. But when you factor in the midcentury effects of climate change, which he predicts will reduce flows in rivers and streams by an additional 42 percent under drought conditions, “the situation is even more serious.” And that’s not all.	0
“Now, you can add yet another problem to the climate change hit list: volcanoes. That’s the word from a new study conducted in Iceland and accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters. Glacier melt in Iceland will cause more volcanoes everywhere. Rather, the authors of the report merely observe that, as warming occurs Iceland’s glaciers are melting at an increased rate, causing the ground beneath them to rise at an accelerated rate (due to the weight of the glaciers being removed). A casual remark by one of the papers authors, Richard Bennett, reported by the University of Arizona was the first mention of a possible link to volcanic activity.	0
“Katowice (Poland) may show us if there will be any domino effect,” from the U.S. withdrawal, Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and an architect of the Paris agreement, said in the AFP report.

“Maybe, in the subsequent months and years, after I get done with trying to rebuild the state and put people back in their homes, I will have the opportunity to ponder the esoteric question of the cause of this storm,” he said this February. We’re rebuilding in places we shouldn’t. The world will experience a rise in sea level of several feet. This means that cities and towns on the shoreline are guaranteed an increase in flooding vulnerability. Some of the damage this will cause is inevitable.	1
The real motivation, he says, is politics. In 2008, Fingar, now a fellow at Stanford University, took the lead in drafting the first national intelligence assessment on the security challenges presented by climate change. Global warming will further destabilize already-volatile parts of the world and should be considered in national security planning. But congressional Republicans dismissed the report as “a waste of resources.” In fact, monitoring environmental factors isn’t much of a departure for intelligence analysts—who have long kept tabs on variables like changing weather patterns, which can affect food production, as a predictor of regional instability. “The Earth system is actually relatively simple when you compare it to people,” Gallaudet says.	0
And of course, it is inspired by her faith, which for Hayhoe, puts a strong emphasis on caring for the weakest and most vulnerable among us. “That gives us even more reason to care about climate change,” says Hayhoe, “because it is affecting people, and is disproportionately affecting the poor, and the vulnerable, and those who cannot care for themselves.” The fact remains, though, that most evangelical Christians in the United States do not think as Hayhoe does. While 64 percent of Americans think global warming is real and caused by human beings, only 44 percent of evangelicals do. Evangelicals in general, explains Hayhoe, tend to be more politically conservative, and can be quite distrusting of scientists (believing, incorrectly, that they’re all a bunch of atheists). Plus, some evangelicals really do go in for that whole “the world is ending” thing—not an outlook likely to inspire much care for the environment.	1
Different countries have different densities, so to speak, of global warming denial. In particular, English-language speaking nations like the US and the UK tend to be relative denialist hotbeds, and their media include a considerable amount of global warming skepticism. By contrast, media researchers have found that in Spanish-speaking countries like Mexico and Chile, as well as in European nations, journalists tend to cast much less doubt on climate research.	1
The public’s skepticism of climate change took a dive after Hurricane Sandy. Fifty-four percent of Americans are now saying that the effects of global warming have already begun. News about global warming is generally exaggerated. For most climate experts, however, the battle is long over—at least when it comes to the science. What remains in dispute is not whether climate change is happening, but how fast things are going to get worse.	2
So these models are running hot!” The reason that the models are running hot is based on a “firm scientific principle,” says Briggs. “If a model is making bad predictions, which these climate models are, the theory that underlies them must be wrong. Atmospheric reaction to carbon dioxide, known as climate sensitivity, is probably too high for these models. “If you take this climate sensitivity model and tone it down, you get a much closer match to reality.” He contends that the computer models are overcompensating for the addition of CO2’s to the atmosphere. Although their findings weren’t that controversial scientifically, it was “unwelcome news” to the IPCC and other “Global Warmists”—“and that’s when the whole thing began to blow-up,” Briggs said.	1
An assessment paid for by DuPont said that the ethanol it will produce there could be more than 100 percent better than gasoline in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The research is among the first to attempt to quantify, over 12 Corn Belt states, how much carbon is lost to the atmosphere when the stalks, leaves and cobs that make up residue are removed and used to make biofuel, instead of left to naturally replenish the soil with carbon. Regardless of how much corn residue is taken off the field, the process contributes to global warming. “I knew this research would be contentious,” said Adam Liska, the lead author and an assistant professor of biological systems engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. “I’m amazed it has not come out more solidly until now.” The Environmental Protection Agency’s own analysis, which assumed about half of corn residue would be removed from fields, found that fuel made from corn residue, also known as stover, would meet the standard in the energy law.	1
Following an early spell in research, Jenifer went to work for the waste strategy team at the Welsh Government for six years until she left to study a PhD in technological innovation for hydrogen production from waste also from Cardiff University.” So, instead of analysing the issue from a strictly engineering perspective – as perhaps, you might hope from something which calls itself the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and not, say, the Institution of Big Fluffy Pie In The Sky Green Fantasies – Baxter does insist in imposing her environmentalist slant. Just have a read of this bit: The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has said that the Government’s focus is “to create policy to ensure energy is affordable and secure and that in the past the balance had swung too far in favour of climate change policies”. This market-led, consumer-based approach would lead to carbon reduction. With historically low oil prices and significant reserves of coal globally, there is potential for the cheapest fuel for power generation to be the one that is most polluting. Green finger-wagging editorialising, or what?	1
The graph showed that after nearly 900 years of relatively stable temperatures, there was a sharp uptick starting in the 20th century. You may have seen a version of the graph, known as the “hockey stick,” in the film An Inconvenient Truth—the rise in carbon dioxide levels* is so steep, Al Gore uses a mechanical ladder to reach the most recent readings. The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate. There, he and his colleagues explained the complex methodology, and the uncertainties, involved in their study; but let’s face it, phrases like “multiproxy data network” and “extensive cross-validation experiments” are lost on most of us. “This,” Mann says with an upward swoop of the arm, “the public understands.” The chart tells “a very simple story.”Watch our video on how we fact-checked the hockey stick graph.	0
“It shows something really surprising,” says deMenocal. “It’s evidence that climate doesn’t respond gradually to gradual forcing. It would be wonderful in global warming if everything just kept pace with the gradual rise in CO2. That’s because there are positive feedback mechanisms that start to kick in and speed things up. For example, when the Arctic sea ice melts, as it has increasingly in recent years, the area of dark blue heat-absorbing ocean increases, raising temperatures, melting more ice, which in turn raises temperatures still further in an snowballing process.	1
“Compared to a moderate climate change scenario, rapid geoengineering implementation reduces temperature velocities towards zero in terrestrial biodiversity hot spots. In contrast, sudden termination increases both ocean and land temperature velocities to unprecedented speeds,” they said. The effects would be two to four times worse than with global warming alone. This story originally appeared in news.com.au.	1
They exposed thick glaciers that formed part of the ice sheet to the ocean, meaning the ice blocks floated out to sea more quickly. Here they quickly melted, adding thousands of tonnes of water to the world’s oceans. If ice shelves in Antarctica undergo similar processes, it could spell disaster for Earth. Combined with melting in Greenland, we could see sea levels rise by almost two meters this century. In the next century, ice loss would get even worse.	0
Last year 130 environmental groups signed on to the Margarita Declaration agreeing that global warming cannot be stopped without ending “the hegemonic capitalist system.” Speaking in Brussels last February the top United Nations climate official, Christiana Figueres, admitted that the goal of environmental activists is not to save the world from ecological calamity but to destroy capitalism. “This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model, for the first time in human history,” Figueres said. This moment requires us to rethink democracy as a global mechanism for enacting policy for and by the planet. The final word comes from the wealthiest man in the world who, having enjoyed capitalism for himself is less enthused about it for the rest of us. Commenting on the challenges facing the world, particularly global warming, Bill Gates says, “If there were such a thing as a world government, we would be better prepared.” The president has forfeited our role on terrorism to Russia.	1
That’s a disconcerting vision to come just on the heels of Sunday’s new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which predicted a nightmarish future if greenhouse gas emissions aren’t slowed soon. “The reserves are going to be able to turn into money, because they’re assuming there isn’t going to be a policy change,” said Natural Resources Defense Council Director of Climate Programs David Hawkins. No matter how bad it gets, the world’s addiction to fossil fuels will be so overwhelming that the governments of the world will just suck it up and let people suffer. The price of carbon would need to rise past $200 per metric ton by 2050 to make burning it so expensive that greenhouse gas concentrations would level off at 450 parts per million, according to the report. That’s orders of magnitude beyond the roughly $9 price that currently exists in Europe’s cap-and-trade market.	0
A Canadian government agency website is using humor to push its view that climate change is destroying the environment. Last week, Policy Horizons Canada, a Canadian government agency, declared that climate change had forced Santa Claus to move his workshop from the North Pole to the South Pole. Thanks to rising global temperatures, rapidly melting Arctic ice and growing human operations in the North, Santa Claus has signed an agreement with the International community to relocate his village next year to operate in an exclusive zone in the South Pole. The post was one of many holiday-themed articles the agency published ahead of the holiday season. They also wrote about: bitcoin, self-driving sleighs, artificial intelligence and 3D printing.	1
The phenomenon of “dark snow” is being recorded from the Himalayas to the Arctic as increasing amounts of dust from bare soil, soot from fires, and ultrafine particles of “black carbon” from industry and diesel engines are being whipped up and deposited sometimes thousands of miles away. The result, say scientists, is a significant dimming of the brightness of the world’s snow and icefields, leading to a longer melt season, which in turn creates feedback where more solar heat is absorbed and the melting accelerates. The Arctic ice cap, which is thought to have lost an average of 12.9 billion tonnes of ice a year between 1992 and 2010 due to general warming, may be losing an extra 27 billion tonnes a year just because of dust, potentially adding several centimeters of sea-level rise by 2100. Satellite measurements, say the authors, show that in the last 10 years the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet has considerably darkened during the melt season, which in some areas is now between 6 and 11 days longer per decade than it was 40 years ago. As glaciers retreat and the snow cover disappears earlier in the year, so larger areas of bare soil are uncovered, which increases the dust erosion, scientists suggest.	0
On top of that they checked their figures by easy markers such as the rise of lead with the start of the industrial age and isotopes only seen in the atomic age. When Kopp and colleagues charted the sea level rise over the centuries — they went back 3,000 years, but aren&apos;t confident in the most distant 200 years — they saw Earth&apos;s sea level was on a downward trend until the industrial age. Sea level rise in the 20th century is mostly man-made. A separate, not-yet-published study by Kopp and others found since 1950, about two-thirds of the U.S. nuisance coastal floods in 27 locales have the fingerprints of man-made warming. And if seas continue to rise, as projected, another 18 inches of sea level rise is going to cause lots of problems and expense, especially with surge during storms, said study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.	1
Where the Green New Deal has energized the left, the idea of a “carbon dividends” plan has won endorsements from bipartisan sources including former cabinet officials, Federal Reserve chairs, Nobel laureate economists, and current members of Congress. Advocates of harnessing market forces say sustaining economic growth is crucial to maintain political support for climate action. A price on carbon can be effective at reducing emissions if it’s tried on a sustained, economy-wide basis. “I don’t think we need to fundamentally rewrite the rules” of the economy to aim for net zero emissions, says Joseph Majkut, a policy expert at the free-market oriented Niskanen Center in Washington, D.C. “I’m not saying that it’s a small transition,” he says, but Americans can check on a carbon tax every five years to see its results and potentially adjust it if needed. But in practice, even middle-of-the-road policy ideas have had trouble succeeding politically.	1
But if modern ocean temperatures are the same as they were during the Eemian, that means our planet is “missing” a devastating sea rise. If oceans were to rise by just 1.8 meters, large swathes of coastal cities would find themselves underwater, turning streets into canals and completely submerging some buildings. Sea levels made this jump 115,000 years ago because of a sudden ice collapse in Antarctica. The continent’s vulnerable West Antarctic ice sheet — which is already retreating again today — released a lot of sea level rise in a hurry. “There’s no way to get tens of meters of sea level rise without getting tens of meters of sea level rise from Antarctica,” said Dr.	1
However, the voyage of the Yong Sheng, backed by the Chinese government, has special significance. This is the first attempt by the world’s biggest exporter to exploit the Arctic’s disappearing ice to reach its biggest market—the European Union. Global warming would affect the planet first in the Arctic. “Temperatures have risen dramatically. At this rate, I would expect the Arctic to be completely free of ice in summer by around 2030.	0
Lukewarmers: Acknowledge that the Earth is getting hotter, but it’s not a big deal. Others argue that it might even be a good thing: See: Rep. Joe Read (R-Mont. Global warming is beneficial to the welfare and business. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) climate of Montana.” The Rapture-ready: Contend that the planet cannot be warming because it was not foretold in the Bible—and even if it were warming, good news! The end times are upon us.	2
And other issues affect the attractiveness of sailing in Arctic waters. The seas around the North Pole may be losing their summer ice cover, but there is still the ever-present danger of icebergs and drifting slabs of pack ice. Satellite photographs may suggest an area is completely clear of ice, but there is still a chance that a ship will encounter drifts of ice. “It is very unlikely that the Yong Sheng will go through these waters on its own. The Russians have the best, most powerful armada of icebreakers.	1
The Checks and Balances report notes that Manhattan Institute was mentioned 65 times in the papers it surveyed. That count includes pieces like Bryce’s April 2010 op-ed in the Washington Post, “Five Myths About Green Energy,” which includes lines like, “[I]n in the electric car’s century-long history, failure tailgates failure.” The piece describes Bryce as a senior fellow at Manhattan Institute, but doesn’t mention the funding. Increasing the use of wind will actually increase our emissions of carbon dioxide. Bryce also popped up in a Christian Science Monitor piece on lessons from the BP oil spill, arguing that nothing can compete with oil—again, with no indication that his organization has a dog in the fight. (Media Matters also posted a piece in 2011 that noted Bryce had made 39 different media appearances that failed to disclose the fossil fuel ties.)	1
They used single cell organisms that are sensitive to salinity, mangroves, coral, sediments and other clues in cores, Horton said. On top of that they checked their figures by easy markers such as the rise of lead with the start of the industrial age and isotopes only seen in the atomic age. Earth&apos;s sea level was on a downward trend until the industrial age. Sea level rise in the 20th century is mostly man-made, the study authors said.

Dead children? I challenge Thom Hartmann to name even one. This is about economic migration and about political instability, not about global warming. As for those five million climate refugees. They’re just a figment.	2
 FILE - This Feb. 22,2013 file photo shows Two heavily damaged homes on the beach in Mantoloking, N.J., from Superstorm Sandy. Man-made global warming may further lessen the likelihood of the freak atmospheric steering currents that last year shoved Superstorm Sandy due west into New Jersey. But don&apos;t celebrate a rare beneficial climate change prediction just yet. The study&apos;s authors said the once-in-700-years path was only one factor in the massive $50 billion killer storm.	2
Arctic sea ice has officially reached its minimum extent for the summer, shrinking to 5.1 million square kilometers. That’s significantly higher than last year’s record low of just over 3.4 million square kilometers, a fact that has led conservative news outlets and even members of Congress to suggest that worries about global warming and melting ice are overstated. But as astronomer and Slate writer Phil Plait explains in this video, these claims are “incredibly misleading.” “You can’t look year-to-year, that’s not the right way to do this,” says Plait.	1
And I’m not the only one. New data released last month by researchers at Yale and George Mason universities show that a lot of Americans are growing far more concerned about climate change, precisely because they’re drawing the links between freaky weather, a climate kicked off-kilter by a fossil-fuel guzzling civilization, and their own lives. Global warming is affecting the weather. As Yale’s Anthony Laiserowitz told the New York Times, “People are starting to connect the dots.” Which is what we must do. As long as this remains one abstract problem in the long list of problems, we’ll never get to it.	0
"“The whole focus of this so-called ‘climate summit’ is to only look at the alleged negatives of using fossils fuels – it’s like an antibiotics summit where you only look at the negative effects of antibiotics.” Epstein, author of the forthcoming book The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, also highlighted the inherent volatility of the global climate. “Nature doesn’t give us a safe climate that we make dangerous,"" he said. It gives us a dangerous climate that we make safe, above all, by using energy from fossil fuels. “My conclusion is that, if we look at the big picture, not only are the economic benefits [of fossil fuels] overwhelmingly positive, but the environmental benefits are overwhelmingly positive,” he said. The U.N. has suffered a number of blows in its push for a climate agreement."	2
“The only effective way of addressing climate change is to make the price of fossil fuels include their cost to society,” said Hansen. “That could be done in a simple way by collecting a fee from the fossil fuel companies that would gradually rise over time—a carbon fee and dividend. I call it a carbon fee because you would give all of the money to the public, a dividend to each legal resident. “ have adopted almost precisely as I proposed it in 2008. The starting level of the fee varies from one proposition to another—I believe that they start at $40 per ton of carbon.	1
The Times has – finally – chosen to publish a story about global warming that did not primarily consist of Andrew Revkin‘s fawning assurances that alarmists were the guardians of holy writ and skeptics are alchemists in the employ of Exxon-Mobil. Prior to this happy event, I thought the chances of the Senate passing a cap and trade bill were slim, but that the possibility still existed. Global warming skeptics may have a point or two after all. Good riddance. But how did we get here?	2
You don’t know what bad times are until you don’t have enough energy to run the machinery of civilization. As suggested by the IEA, “Much is riding on Iraq’s success… Without this supply growth from Iraq, oil markets would be set for difficult times.” Continuing Reliance on Fossil Fuels For all the talk of the need to increase reliance on renewable sources of energy, fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—will continue to provide most of the additional energy supplies needed to satisfy soaring world demand. The world is still failing to put the global energy system onto a more sustainable path. In the United States, for instance, the increased extraction of oil and gas from shale formations has largely silenced calls for government investment in renewable technology. In its editorial on the IEA report, for example, the Wall Street Journal ridiculed such investment.	0
The research also received $100,000 from the Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy Research, which was created by Bill Gates. Unlike previous efforts, the temperature data from various sources was not homogenized by hand—a key criticism by climate skeptics. The average global land temperature has risen by about 1 degree Celsius since the mid-1950s. But the team did not look for possible fingerprints to explain this warming. The latest data analysis reached much further back in time but, crucially, also searched for the most likely cause of the rise by plotting the upward temperature curve against suspected “forcings.” It analyzed the warming impact of solar activity—a popular theory among climate skeptics—but found that, over the past 250 years, the contribution of the sun has been “consistent with zero.” Volcanic eruptions were found to have caused short dips in the temperature rise in the period 1750–1850, but “only weak analogues” in the 20th century.	1
Netflix host “Science Guy” Bill Nye has a new solution for the world’s environmental problems: taxing cow farts. “Well, this is what we can do and it’s a win-win: to have a fee on carbon. So if you are raising livestock and producing a lot of carbon dioxide with your farm equipment and the exhaust from the animals, then you would pay a fee on that and it would be reflected in the price of meat, reflected in the price of fish, reflected in the price of peanuts. “This would be a free-market way to reckon the real cost of a meat diet to the world,” Nye continued. “But conservatives now are against such a thing because they’re against any regulation, any tax or any government involvement in anything.	1
And it makes all the sea level rise that we’ve seen so far due to global warming appear piddly and insignificant. That’s why scientists have long feared a day like this would come. Major glaciers that are part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet appear to have become irrevocably destabilized. The whole process may still play out on the scale of centuries, but due to the particular dynamics of this ice sheet, the collapse of these major glaciers now “appears unstoppable,” according to NASA (whose researchers are behind one of the two studies).	0
Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP This story originally appeared in the Guardian and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Last month was the hottest May globally. The record heat, combined with increasingly certain predictions of an El Niño, means experts are now speculating whether 2014 could become the hottest year on record. Data published by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Monday showed the average land and ocean surface temperature last month was 0.74C above the 20th century average of 14.8C, making it the highest on record.	1
Fortune 500 companies, including the biggest oil companies, are assuming their emissions will be taxed at some point, a survey by research firm CDP found. “I expect they’re probably holding back on the full extent they’re looking at carbon risk as it can help them gain an edge over their rivals and lot of this information is proprietary,” says Caldecott. The CRVT is the first iteration of a carbon risk tool and presently only offers a somewhat generalized analysis. But he says the response from Bloomberg customers has been positive and the tool foreshadows a future when algorithms will routinely calculate the financial impact of other environmental risks, such as water shortages and extreme weather spawned by climate change. The key will be to what extent and how fast investors adopt carbon risk as a standard part of their financial analysis, says Ryan Salmon, manager of the oil and gas program for Ceres, a Boston-based non-profit that promotes corporate sustainability.	1
As a result, it foresees a peak in global oil output occurring around 2020 at about 91 million barrels per day, with a decline to 78 million barrels by 2035. It would be premature to suggest that the “450 Scenario” will be the immediate roadmap for humanity, since it’s clear enough that, for the moment, we are on a highway to hell that combines the IEA’s first two scenarios. A global temperature increase of even 2 degrees Celsius would be enough to produce catastrophic climate effects. But as the effects of climate change become more pronounced in our lives, count on one thing: the clamor for government action will grow more intense, and so eventually we’re likely to see some variation of the 450 Scenario take shape. In the process, the world’s demand for oil will be sharply constricted, eliminating the incentive to invest in costly new production schemes.	0
James Hudnall did a brilliant job of dismantling Obama’s atomic promises, pointing out that even if the President happened to be uncharacteristically sincere in this case, no new nuclear plant will be built in a dog’s lifetime, even if the pooch happens to one of those little yip-dogs that seem to live forever. Based on what we have seen of his administration so far, the same is true of Obama’s newfound commitment to offshore drilling. Burning fossil fuels will indeed result in catastrophic climate change. According to the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, “we can’t drill our way out” of this supposed problem. Actually, we can.	0
But Barnes and Sobel said because so many other factors are involved this doesn&apos;t mean fewer storms hitting the New York region. This is only one path; storms usually come from the south instead of from the east like Sandy. Scientists agree that future storms will be slightly stronger because of global warming and that sea level is rising faster than researchers once thought. Those factors likely will overwhelm the predicted change in steering currents, he said. Rutgers University climate scientist Jennifer Francis, one of the major proponents of the jet-stream-is-changing theory, said she doesn&apos;t see the jet stream becoming stronger and moving north as Barnes says the models predict.	1
“Whatever environmentalists may hope, the Obama White House and congressional Democrats are unlikely to make global warming a top issue in 2013 or 2014,” she writes. The extreme weather events of the 2012, from Superstorm Sandy to an historic drought, are unlikely to shift their priorities, she said. The stark truth is that severe weather events alone will not cause global warming to pop to the top of the national agenda. “Fresh strategies will be needed, based on new understandings of political obstacles and opportunities.” Skocpol, a political scientist, compares the failed push for a climate law unfavorably to the ultimately successful effort to pass health care reform. She interviewed key players in the push for climate legislation in 2009 and 2010, as well as activists from the tea party groups who helped sink those efforts.	1
You have to be careful, given that a Category 1 hurricane in October is not itself unusual—and what’s really unique about Sandy is its collision with another, extratropical or winter storm system. Still, there is much that can be said here, even though scientists are careful to emphasize the remaining uncertainties: 1. Global warming has added more moisture to the atmosphere, such that for any storm event, including Sandy, there will be more precipitation as a consequence. And excess rainfall is one of the top three sources of hurricane damage (the others being wind and storm surge). Explains meteorologist Greg Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research: “I have no equivocation in saying that all heavy rainfall events, including this one, have an element of climate change in them, and the level of that contribution will increase in the future.” 2.	0
The latter town is home to America’s largest navy base, whose miles of waterfront installations would be at risk of being locked in to future sea level rises by the 2040s. The Pentagon has already begun actively planning for a future under climate change, including relocating bases. About half the population of Cambridge, Massachusetts, across the Charles River from Boston and home to Harvard and MIT, could be locked in to a future below sea level by the early 2060s. Several coastal cities in Texas were also vulnerable. But the region at highest risk was Florida, which has dozens of towns which will be locked by century’s end.	0

The latest version of the NIPCC’s Climate Change Reconsidered series was published in September to coincide with the release of an early draft of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. By relying upon climate models that do not properly account for the impact of natural influences, the U.N. has greatly overstated the amount of warming that is likely to occur as a result of rising CO2, according to Singer’s team of researchers. Any warming that may occur is likely to be modest and cause no net harm to the global environment or to human well-being. This file picture shows an enormous iceberg (R) breaking off the Knox Coast in the Australian Antarctic Territory on January 11, 2008. A UN panel said on 27 September 2013 it was more certain than ever that humans were causing global warming and predicted temperatures would rise by 0.3 to 4.8 degrees Celsius (0.5-8.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.	2
All the decarbonization we can do isn’t going to change the climate much. 6. Carbon dioxide is coming out of your nose right now. CO2 concentrations in previous eras have been many times higher than they are today. 7.	1
"Richard Tol, a professor of economics at Sussex University in England, said he disagreed with some findings of the summary to be released later this month in Japan, where scientists from 100 countries are currently meeting to edit and approve the report. ""The drafts became too alarmist,"" Tol told Reuters, acknowledging that some other authors ""strongly disagree with me."" Economic growth and poverty reduction will slow down and global food prices will rise between 3 and 84 percent by 2050 because of warmer temperatures and changes in rain patterns, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. The report is intended to help governments reach global a climate pact at a U.N. summit in Paris in 2015, according to Reuters. ""The report is a product of the scientific community and not of any individual author,"" the U.N.&apos;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a statement to Reuters."	1
The darker open waters now absorb more solar radiation, accelerating the melt. “The ice is weak so it opens up water and allows more sunlight in which warms the water more which makes the ice break up more – so it accelerates the melt. There is hardly any old, multi-year ice left. We are seeing less and less old thick ice,” says Toberg. The longer term implications of the great melt of 2012 are hard to call, say climate scientists who caution that more research is needed.	1
"Fox News Radio's John Gibson said most Americans see the Paris Accord as a ""European project."" China, Russia, and India are not held to the same standards as America.

Two years before, the devastating Pakistan floods destroyed 570,000 hectares of crops, and 80 percent of food stored was lost in some areas. Oxfam also cites a study that suggested the 2011 drought in East Africa and famine in Somalia were made more likely by climate change. Natural events such as storms, floods, and droughts happen anyway and it is hard to blame particular occurrences on global warming. On this, the panel is expected to say on Friday that extreme weather effects are more likely because of climate change, but will stop well short of attributing specific events solely to climate change. Tim Gore from Oxfam said: “We want a world in which everyone enjoys the right to affordable and nutritious food, and we cannot allow climate change to throw us off course.	2
The report also conceded that the technique is not without its downsides: it could negatively affect crop yields, lead to droughts or cause even more extreme weather. The proposal does not discuss the issue of greenhouse gases which are reportedly a leading cause in climate change. It’s only a temporary Band-Aid covering a problem that will persist essentially forever, actually hundreds of thousands of years for fossil fuel CO2 to finally go away naturally. It will be tempting to continue to procrastinate on cleaning up our energy system, but we’d be leaving the planet on a form of life-support. If a future generation failed to pay their climate bill they would get all of our warming all at once.” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.	0
Mere agreement with the 97% will indicate that one is a supporter of science and superior to anyone denying disaster. This actually satisfies a psychological need for many people. It’s just a trick created by pretending that all the scientists who agree that humans make a contribution to global warming (ie almost everyone). Which simply isn’t the case. The ‘warmest years on record’ meme Alarmists have been shrieking a lot recently that most of the hottest years on record – 14 out of 15, according to the UN – have happened since 2000.	2
When it comes to the rest of the planet, however, such concerns, they claim, should be outweighed by a “humanitarian” impulse to provide cheap fossil energy to poor people. Drawing on the arguments of Danish environmental renegade Bjørn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist, they argue that tending to the needs of the poor constitutes a greater priority than curbing global warming. There is a humanitarian imperative to meeting these growing global energy needs. Asked why global warming shouldn’t be of greater concern, the Exxon CEO parroted Lomberg’s anti-environmental perspective. “I think there are much more pressing priorities that we… need to deal with,” Tillerson told the Council on Foreign Relations in June 2012.	1
Flanked by Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, Admiral Blair testified before congress with a remarkably straight face. The “Statement for the Record” from his testimony contains these gems: We continue to assess that global climate change will have wide-ranging implications for US national security interests over the next 20 years because it will aggravate existing world problems–such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions–that threaten state stability. The effects of climate change are accelerating, particularly in the Arctic region and on mountain glaciers that impact critical watersheds. The thawing of the permafrost across vast stretches of Russia, including areas in which there are oil and gas deposits and over which there are pipelines, will both put existing infrastructure at risk and make its modernization and replacement more difficult. Referring to Cambodia and Vietnam, he says: Large-scale migration from rural and coastal areas into cities and across borders could increase friction between diverse social groups already under stress from climate change… Together with the Maldives, which is at risk of complete obliteration, these two countries are likely to remain powerful advocates for developed nations to remember the human costs of climate change.	0
Carbon taxes are viewed by many on the left as an easy way to price fossil fuels out of the marketplace, making renewable energy comparably more affordable. Opponents of the plan say it’s another form of socialistic wealth distribution that will dramatically raise energy costs. Energy costs will increase not only because of the tax, but also because energy companies will raise prices across the board knowing that all consumers have more money to spend, thanks to carbon-tax dividends.	1
That, they claimed, was what made a new mega-energy boom possible. “This is a real energy revolution,” the Journal noted, “even if it’s far from the renewable energy dreamland of so many government subsidies and mandates.” Other commentaries were similarly focused on the US outpacing Saudi Arabia and Russia, even if some questioned whether the benefits would be as great as advertised or obtainable at an acceptable cost to the environment. Gas prices will not drop significantly because oil is a global commodity and those prices are largely set by international market forces. “[T]he US may be slightly more protected, but it doesn’t give you the energy independence some people claim,” he told the New York Times. Some observers focused on whether increased output and job creation could possibly outweigh the harm that the exploitation of extreme energy resources like fracked oil or Canadian tar sands was sure to do to the environment.	1
"Storms like so-called Superstorm Sandy, he said, are the face of the new environmental future. ""This is the global threat of our time. And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late. ""That is our job. That is our task."	0
At some point, every pine, fir, and spruce will be imperiled. If, in 2007, Swetnam was out on a limb, these days it’s likely that the limb has burned off and it’s getting ever easier to imagine the destruction of forests on a region-wide scale, however disturbing that may be. The forests of the western United States account for 20% to 40% of total US carbon sequestration. At some point, as western forests succumb to the ills of climate change, they will become a net releaser of atmospheric carbon, rather than one of the planet’s principle means of storing it. Contrary to the claims of climate deniers, the prevailing models scientists use to predict change are conservative.	1
A study published last October found that on reefs around Little Cayman, a kind of suburb island adjacent to Grand Cayman, coral cover fell from 26 to 14 percent just between 1999 and 2004. Since the early 1980s, coral cover across the entire Caribbean has plummeted 80 percent, so that living corals now cover only 10 percent, on average, of available surface area. What’s happening there is a microcosm of a global trend: 90 percent of the world’s coral will be at risk of disappearance by 2030, thanks primarily to ocean acidification and global warming, both products of greenhouse gases released by human activity. Tim Austin, an ecologist with the Cayman Department of Environment, has seen this transformation first-hand. In April, Austin, who was born and raised on Grand Cayman, took me on a snorkeling trip to some of the island’s hardest-hit reefs (watch the video above for an under-the-waves tour).	0
" April 13, 2014: Ramon Pichs Madruga, Co-Chairman of the IPCC Working Group III, Ottmar Edenhofer, Co-Chairman of the IPCC Working Group III, and Rejendra K. Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC, from left, pose prior to a press conference as part of a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in Berlin, Germany. (AP) BERLIN – The cost of keeping global warming in check is ""relatively modest,"" but only if the world acts quickly to reverse the buildup of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, the head of the U.N.&apos;s expert panel on climate change said Sunday. Such gases, mainly CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, rose on average by 2.2 percent a year in 2000-2010, driven by the use of coal in the power sector. Without additional measures to contain emissions, global temperatures will rise about 5 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 compared to current levels, the panel said. ""The longer we delay the higher would be the cost,"" IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri told The Associated Press after the panel&apos;s weeklong session in Berlin."	1
“I’m sitting in LaGuardia on my way to Greenland, people riveted to the TV with news about fire across the US,” Box remembers. “It was really dramatic, but I’m like, ‘Hold on, we need to really measure the soot.” Thus was born the Dark Snow project, in which Box and colleagues are trying to crowd-fund an expedition to sample the ice at high elevations and determine just how much soot from global wildfires and pollution are amplifying Greenland’s melting. Greenland is not only melting. And what’s more, we may be blowing past a point of irreversibility, where the world commits, irrevocably, to a level of sea level rise that, as it unfolds over the coming centuries, would devastate many coastal megacities. Just consider one striking statistic from Box: The summer melt from Greenland in 2012 alone added a millimeter to the global sea level.	1
The correlation between solar activity and water temperature is even higher than the correlation between solar activity and land temperature. The paper, by Dr Zhao Xinhua and Dr Feng Xueshang, adds that a peer-reviewer said the results “provide a possible explanation for the global warming”. The release of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases contributed to 90 percent or even higher of the observed increase in the global average temperature in the past 50 years. However, the new paper casts doubt on the IPCC’s assertion: Research shows that the current warming does not exceed the natural fluctuations of climate. The climate models of IPCC seem to underestimate the impact of natural factors on the climate change, while overstate that of human activities.	0
What then is the best approach to help them stand up? Since human greenhouse gas emissions are a valuable component of the industrial processes that unleash economic activity and raise living standards, doesn’t the Kyoto Protocol put the undeveloped world in more of a compromised position? The threat to humanity comes more from global warming policies. Bonner Cohen, a senior fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has a keen understanding of the U.N.’s motivations. “It was inherently self-serving for the IPCC to identify human activities as the cause of global warming,” he explains.	2
Bryan Walsh, a senior editor at Time Magazine, engaged in a series of half-truths and anti-science speculation Monday to blame the cold temperatures hitting much of the country this week on man-made Global Warming. Apparently, temperatures reverting back to pre-Climate Change hysteria norms is proof of Climate Change, or something. Science disagrees with his phony claim that this cold snap has anything to do with Climate Change, Global Warming, or whatever these Truthers are calling it this week. If you want a real laugh, the infamous Polar Vortex Walsh is blaming on Global Warming today is the same infamous Polar Vortex Time Magazine blamed on Global Cooling in 1974. Walsh’s deception gets especially oily when he laments the “Sea ice is vanishing from the Arctic thanks to climate change.” Why doesn’t Walsh inform his readers that in the Antarctic ice has hit record levels?	2
"Even the scientists were surprised to see how much science was already there and how much they could really differentiate and how great are the benefits of limiting global warming at 1.5 compared to 2.” “[N]ow more than ever we know that every bit of warming matters,” Krug said. The international Paris accord climate agreement, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in June, set a goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal. In a statement obtained by CNN, former Vice President Al Gore, who is also an ecological activist, said, ""Today the world's leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear — that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy."" ""Unfortunately, the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past,"" Gore added."	0
Systemically. Following this debate, I’ve been struck by the strong impression that people are making things too complicated. Global warming made Sandy directly and unmistakably worse, because of its contribution to sea level rise. “I keep telling people the one lock you have here is sea level rise,” meteorologist Scott Mandia explained to me recently. “It’s the one thing that absolutely made the storm worse that you can’t wiggle out of.” Mandia is an expert on the subject at Suffolk County Community College, and coauthor of the new book Rising Sea Levels: An Introduction to Cause and Impact.	0
Her paper is likely to cause a stir among environmental groups hoping to see action on climate change during Obama’s second term. Skocpol, in her analysis, does not offer much cause for optimism. Whatever environmentalists may hope, the Obama White House and congressional Democrats are unlikely to make global warming a top issue in 2013 or 2014. The extreme weather events of the 2012, from Superstorm Sandy to an historic drought, are unlikely to shift their priorities, she said. “The stark truth is that severe weather events alone will not cause global warming to pop to the top of the national agenda,” Skocpol went on.	1
Rising global temperatures during the 19th and 20th centuries may be linked to greater plant photosynthesis. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California at Merced, estimated based on its models “the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent over the 200-year record captured,” according to an article published on the UC Merced website. Photosynthesis is the process of converting carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, which power plants, using sunlight.	1
However, this year the weather has been cooler and sea ice coverage will certainly not drop to last year’s levels. That means there will be more sea ice en route and more danger. Summer sea ice in the Arctic will disappear sometime this century. Cover has dropped at a rate of around 13 percent every 10 years for the last few decades. Some believe this rate is accelerating and expect all summer sea ice to disappear in a few years.	1
Meanwhile, the grassroots opposition uniting farmers and ranchers, environmentalists and scientists is growing in the heartland states. Last month, the coalition demanded that the State Department issue a supplemental environmental impact statement. Expansion of high carbon projects such as the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline will undermine the good work being done in local communities across the country to fight climate change and reduce our dependence on oil. As a result, it will surely become harder to derail the efforts of TransCanada and Koch Industries to ram a pipeline filled with toxic tar sands oil right through David Daniel’s property. Will a pipeline leak one day kill off his old growth hardwood trees, foul his three natural springs, and poison the deer now roaming his land?	0
“I would be sad to lose the spinach and egg soup,” he says. “It is my favorite.” Corn _-0-_/Flickr If corn bread, creamed corn, or creamy fried confetti corn are some of your Thanksgiving favorites, you ought to be pretty worried about climate change. In a worst-case global warming scenario, corn, cotton, and soy-bean yields could decrease by 80 percent by 2100. The drought the Midwest saw this summer was the worst in half a century, and the USDA predicts corn yield this year may plummet to around 122 bushels per acre—the lowest since 1995. If the heartland falls through, corn production may move north to Canada.	1
“Give climate change credit for one thing: it’s endlessly versatile,” Kluger writes breathlessly in his article How Climate Change Leads to Volcanoes (Really). “There was a time we called it global warming, which meant what it said: the globe would get warmer. We appreciated that a planet running a fever is just like a person running a fever, which is to say it has a whole lot of other symptoms: in this case, droughts, floods, wildfires, habitat disruption, sea level rise, species loss, crop death and more. “Now, you can add yet another problem to the climate change hit list: volcanoes. That’s the word from a new study conducted in Iceland and accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters.	0
“Having a child imposes high emissions on the world, while the parents get the benefit. So like with any high-cost luxury, we should limit our indulgence,” writes Rieder. You could do everything possible to minimize your own carbon footprint. I think the answer is clearly no.” Rieder states that if families having fewer children reduces their contribution to carbon emissions, then they should do so even if that emission has no real-world effect in order to satisfy Rieder’s “morals.” Despite Rieder’s claims that having a large number of children is essentially immoral, he claims that he is not suggesting that parents be shamed or forced to only have a certain number of children; he simply wants to “discuss the ethics of making babies with care and respect.” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

I do not deny that it has costs associated with it. Any first-generation technology will. But we are looking at carbon the same way we look at every pollutant under the Clean Air Act. We recognize that these power plants are going to be around for decades. If coal wants a place in a carbon-constrained future, they have to look at technology like this.	1
Be sure to watch the following clip, in which Lord Monckton eviscerates Al Gore and the other global-warming hoaxers who refuse to come out of their holes and fight like men: [youtube JBQYlIikLBM nolink] Man made CO2 is an insignificant part of the earth’s atmosphere. The warmists are using falsified results to push their arguments, as Climategate demonstrated. The end goal of this scheme is global governance with the creeps who polluted Copenhagen with their presence as our future overlords. Not appealing in the least. Couple that with a record winter storm this year, which belies everything the warmists have been claiming previously.	1

Tsunamis are one of the deadliest natural disasters – and experts say they could get even worse. A new Science Advances study modeled the impact of tsunamis based on sea level increases, and discovered worrying results. Rising sea levels allowed tsunamis to reach much further inland, significantly increasing the risk of floods. This means small tsunamis that might not be deadly today could wreak havoc in the future.

(AP Photo/Roy Kaltschmidt, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) WASHINGTON – The United States is spewing 50 percent more methane — a potent heat-trapping gas — than the federal government estimates, a new comprehensive scientific study says. Much of it is coming from just three states: Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. That means methane may be a bigger global warming issue than thought. Methane is 21 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, the most abundant global warming gas, although it doesn&apos;t stay in the air as long. Much of that extra methane, also called natural gas, seems to be coming from livestock, including manure, belches, and flatulence, as well as leaks from refining and drilling for oil and gas, the study says.	0
EPA gets to set a standard for new. For the existing, EPA sets guidelines for what we think is appropriate, but then states develop plans that work for them, taking into consideration their specific energy mix. This will help us begin to more concretely talk about what’s already happening at the state and local level to reduce carbon emissions in the electricity sector. We don’t just have to do it. We can do it in a way that grows the economy and saves people money.	0
While the report urges urgent policy changes, it also concludes that such changes may have a limited effect, regardless: “Aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions,” it says, “may substantially reduce but do not eliminate the risk to California of extreme sea-level rise from Antarctic ice loss.” Given the probability of sea level rises, “preparedness efforts, adaptation actions and hazard mitigation undertaken today” can help prevent damage along the coastline. California government officials have occasionally overhyped the threat to coastal areas. Rising sea levels could force Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to be moved. He was forced to correct that statement after it was pointed out that LAX is at least 108 feet above sea level, and therefore safe from rising seas even under the most extreme scenario. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.	0
The latest data analysis reached much further back in time but, crucially, also searched for the most likely cause of the rise by plotting the upward temperature curve against suspected “forcings.” It analyzed the warming impact of solar activity—a popular theory among climate skeptics—but found that, over the past 250 years, the contribution of the sun has been “consistent with zero.” Volcanic eruptions were found to have caused short dips in the temperature rise in the period 1750–1850, but “only weak analogues” in the 20th century. “Much to my surprise, by far the best match came to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, measured from atmospheric samples and air trapped in polar ice,” said Muller. Global warming is caused by human greenhouse gases. In an unconventional move aimed at appeasing climate skeptics by allowing “full transparency,” the results have been publicly released before being peer-reviewed by the Journal of Geophysical Research. All the data and analysis is now available to be freely scrutinized at the BEST website.	1
No other region has embraced goals as ambitious as these, and none has invested greater resources in their implementation. Any wavering from this path would signal a significant retrenchment in the global climate struggle. Europe is preparing to rein in the pace of its drive to slow global warming. At issue is not the implementation of the 20-20-20 plan, which is well on its way to being achieved, but on the goals that should follow it. Climate activists and green energy entrepreneurs have been calling for an even more ambitious set of targets for 2030 and beyond; many manufacturers and other major energy consumers have been pushing for a slower pace of change, claiming that increased reliance on renewables is driving up energy prices and so diminishing their economic competitiveness.	1
Will climate change leave your investment portfolio stranded like a polar bear on melting ice floe? If your pension fund or 401(k) manager invests in fossil-fuel companies, it just might. A third of the world’s oil, coal and other fossil fuel reserves must remain untouched until 2050 to stave off catastrophic climate change. That, naturally, freaked out some investors. What’s the future worth of an ExxonMobil or a Chevron is governments ever get their act together and impose carbon taxes that make burning that dinosaur juice unprofitable?	0
He has lived in Utah since 2006 but still visits Nepal every spring or fall, where he participates in treks and climate campaigns. He says the landscape changes can be clearly seen from the summit of Everest, which by most measures is the tallest mountain in the world. It used to be more snow and ice, but now it’s more rock. “It’s very dangerous for climbing.” Soot produced by stoves, power plants, brick kilns, and vehicles throughout the region is wafting up and across the Himalayas. The black carbon is settling on glaciers, which appears to be hastening their demise by absorbing heat from the sun.	1
"With SB 350, we deepen our commitment,"" Brown said in a statement. Earlier this month, scientists at the University of Wyoming reported finding historical evidence of extreme wildfire seasons in the Rocky Mountain region. Such fires happened hundreds of years ago, after global temperatures had risen slightly. The researchers studied layers of charcoal particles in the sediment beneath ponds in northern Colorado's Mount Zirkel Wilderness, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. Core samples from the bottom of the ponds showed that wildfires 1,000 years ago were more than two-and-a-half times more frequent than they were in the 20th century."	1
The very next day, on his radio show, Limbaugh was talking about the Syrian civil war. He talked about the claim that the war is in part due to severe drought in that area caused by global warming: [The claim is that the Syrian civil war] wouldn’t be happening at all and there would have been the use of chemical weapons if it weren’t for global warming. The Arctic Ice Sheet is at a record size for this time of year. They told us the ice was melting in the Arctic Ice Sheet. It’s not.	1
Mere agreement with the 97% will indicate that one is a supporter of science and superior to anyone denying disaster. This actually satisfies a psychological need for many people. Humans make a contribution to global warming. Which simply isn’t the case.

"The post implied that climate change has made Santa a refugee. ""Santa’s relocation agreement marks the first time that the international community agrees on a common legal definition of climate change that includes refugees as corporations, as well as individuals,” the post said. This deal is expected to lead to the deployment of a global climate change refugee visa system that in the near future could help to more easily relocate individuals and corporations facing the impacts of climate change. Some climate change alarmists have predicted that billions of people worldwide could become victims of man-made climate change in the near future, forcing them to leave their homeland and move elsewhere. Many experts believe that Europe is already a favored settling area of climate change refugees, according to Fox Business."	1
This has crucial implications for the region’s agriculture and energy security, which depends on hydropower. Amid the troubling signs, however, researchers outlined a path to prosperity: large-scale, transnational investment, combined with closely coordinated local and national actions. At the global level, nations must adopt transformative climate change policies. Locally, improved transportation and communication access can help alert residents to dangerous conditions and enable them to find safety. Particular attention should be paid to the education and empowerment of women, the report urges, as they already bear the majority of farming and nurturing responsibilities in high-risk mountain areas.	0
On the contrary, it is essential for life on our planet and levels as high as 5000 ppm are considered safe on our submarines and on the space station (current atmospheric levels are around 400 ppm, while, due to our breathing, indoor levels can be much higher). The Nation article is typical in that it makes many bizarre claims in a brief space. A runaway greenhouse effect on Venus led to temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Of course, no one can claim that the earth is subject to such a runaway, but even on Venus, the hot surface depends primarily on the closeness of Venus to the sun and the existence of a dense sulfuric acid cloud covering the planet. Relatedly, Mars, which also has much more CO2 than the earth, is much further from the sun and very cold.	1
The growing fear is that as the ice retreats, the warming of the sea water will allow offshore permafrost to release ever greater quantities of methane. A giant reservoir of the greenhouse gas, in the form of gas hydrates on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), could be emitted, either slowly over 50 years or catastrophically fast over a shorter time frame, say the researchers. The ramifications of vanishing ice will also be felt far from the poles. “The imminent disappearance of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will have enormous implications for both the acceleration of climate change, and the release of methane from off-shore waters which are now able to warm up in the summer,” said Prof Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar ocean physics group at Cambridge University and one of the authors of the paper published in the journal Nature. “This massive methane boost will have major implications for global economies and societies.	0
On top of the fact that we have seen much stronger storms hit these areas before with more frequency, the premise of the argument lacks credence because global temperatures have not increased since the late 1990’s. Anthropogenic global warming activists claim that all extreme weather events are somehow related to “global warming,” which has been re-termed “climate change” since global temperatures are no longer warming. Global tropical activity, which can be measured using the ACE Index (Accumulated Cyclone Energy), is near record lows according to peer-reviewed research. But one cannot simply equate global conditions with regional weather events, which is a cornerstone of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arguments. We are seeing increased tropical activity in the Atlantic because we are in a warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).	1
Proponents of the theory humans are primarily responsible for global warming have said for two decades that warmer temperatures would cause significant problems for the people of Africa. Crops would fail, water would dry up, and the lack of stability, coupled with these problems, would cause significant climate-change-related wars. Global warming has already caused significant crises in Africa. “In violence-plagued northern Mali, a desiccated landscape of dust and mud huts where the average rainfall is a third less than it was nearly two decades ago, scholars recently blamed a climate change–induced drought for fueling conflict between Tuareg separatist rebels, who need water and grass for their cattle herds, and government-backed forces. In March, the National Academy of Sciences published a peer-reviewed study stating that ‘there is evidence that the 2007–2010 drought contributed to the conflict in Syria.	0
It is safe to assume that climate change, especially when combined with growing supply shortages, will result in a significant reduction in the planet’s vital resources, augmenting the kinds of pressures that have historically led to conflict, even under better circumstances. In this way, according to the Chatham House report, climate change is best understood as a “threat multiplier… a key factor exacerbating existing resource vulnerability” in states already prone to such disorders. Climate change will reduce crop output in many areas, sending global food prices soaring and triggering unrest among those already pushed to the limit under existing conditions. “Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as droughts, heat waves, and floods, will also result in much larger and frequent local harvest shocks around the world… These shocks will affect global food prices whenever key centers of agricultural production area are hit—further amplifying global food price volatility.” This, in turn, will increase the likelihood of civil unrest. When, for instance, a brutal heat wave decimated Russia’s wheat crop during the summer of 2010, the global price of wheat (and so of that staple of life, bread) began an inexorable upward climb, reaching particularly high levels in North Africa and the Middle East.	0
Indeed, “global cooling” and “global warming” have both served as scare tactics for what is really behind the movement – global governance under new economic rules. In 2000 French President Jacques Chirac said in a speech at The Hague that the Kyoto Protocol represented “the first component of an authentic global governance.” Former Vice President Al Gore spoke at Oxford in 2009 on the need to change how we live to save the planet. The real goal in global warming is to redistribute the world’s wealth. “This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore,” Endenhofer said. Last year 130 environmental groups signed on to the Margarita Declaration agreeing that global warming cannot be stopped without ending “the hegemonic capitalist system.” Speaking in Brussels last February the top United Nations climate official, Christiana Figueres, admitted that the goal of environmental activists is not to save the world from ecological calamity but to destroy capitalism.	2
Flooding in Breezy Point, QueensBrett Brownell, Mother Jones Superstorm Sandy—and its revival of the issue of climate change, most prominently through Michael Bloomberg’s sudden endorsement—probably aided President Obama’s reelection victory last night. But at the same time, there has been a vast debate about the true nature of the storm’s connections to global warming (as well as plenty of denialism regarding those connections). Global warming caused Sandy. Systemically. Following this debate, I’ve been struck by the strong impression that people are making things too complicated.	0
When you do put CO2 into the models, they all show a decline, she says. “Just because there was possibly less ice in some areas at other times, that doesn’t mean it’s not human-induced now”. We can expect the Arctic to be ice-free in summer within 20 years. “The ice won’t go away the whole year. It will still be cold enough in the Arctic to freeze in winter.	0
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are moving votes to overturn the entire set of EPA climate rules, based on the argument that carbon capture technology still does not work, and on Wednesday the house of representatives’ science committee is looking at CCS technology. The 582 megawatt facility is expected to burn through around 4 million tonnes of low-grade lignite coal a year, all mined from the hills just behind the plant. But the plant will strip out about two-thirds of carbon dioxide emissions, leaving emissions at about the same level as cleaner-burning natural gas. “The carbon footprint is essentially the same or maybe even less than a natural gas plant that doesn’t have carbon capture,” said Randall Rush, the Southern Company engineer who spent 25 years bringing the plant to life. The diverted CO2, instead of going into the atmosphere, would be pumped to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, and used by two Mississippi companies for enhanced oil recovery.	1
Glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region are a critical water source for some 250 million people in the mountains as well as to 1.65 billion others in the river valleys below, the report said. The glaciers feed 10 of the world’s most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy, and directly or indirectly supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air and income. Impacts on people from their melting will range from worsened air pollution to more extreme weather, while lower pre-monsoon river flows will throw urban water systems and food and energy production off-kilter.

How will far-left environmentalists save themselves from total embarrassment? Interestingly, at least some climate scientists are already beginning to drop hints about how they might react. Global warning will be overridden by this effect, giving humankind and the Earth 30 years to sort out our pollution. Rather than admit that they might be wrong and that warming could be driven primarily by factors other than carbon-dioxide emissions, Zharkova suggests instead that an extreme cooling period would push the red line people like Al Gore are always ranting about 50 years into the future. This conveniently gives the environmental left and many Democrats a doomsday deadline far enough off into the future that it will theoretically affect most people now living (or at least their kids) but not so far off that people aren’t concerned about it.	2
"China&apos;s historical emissions are expected to overtake those of the U.S. in the next decade. The IPCC summary also refrained from detailed discussions on what level of financial transfers are needed to help developing countries shift to cleaner energy and adapt to climate change. Flooding, droughts and other climate impacts could have devastating effects on economies, agriculture and human health, particularly in developing countries.

""The administration is in direct conflict with American businesses, states, cities and citizens leading the transformation."" Rising global temperatures during the 19th and 20th centuries could be linked to greater plant photosynthesis. According to the study, ""the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent"" over the 200 years the record reported.

Dramatic cuts in emissions—much greater than Barack Obama and other world leaders have so far agreed on—could save nearly 1,000 of those towns, by averting the sea-level rise, the study found. “Hundreds of American cities are already locked into watery futures and we are growing that group very rapidly,” Strauss said. Each 1 degree Celsius rise in atmospheric warming would lead eventually to 2.3 meters of sea-level rise. The latest study takes those figures, and factors in the current rate of carbon emissions, as well as the best estimate of global temperature sensitivity to pollution. For the study, a location was deemed “under threat” if 25 percent of its current population lives below the locked-in future high-tide level.	1
“At CBS climate liars are hard at work,” he commented, adding “The CBS claim about a temperature of 27F at Summit is so naive that it barely deserves a comment. As anybody who has been skiing knows full well, when you are up a mountain and the sun comes out, it can get very warm with the sunlight reflecting of the snow.” The CBS article goes on to quote University of Montana glaciologist Joel Harper, who asserts that Greenland warming up is a problem because “Greenland contributes about 40 percent of current sea level rise.” Nair adds: “Over the past century, the world’s oceans have risen 4 to 8 inches. Sea level rise will be the greatest environmental threat to coastal cities from Miami to Mumbai. However, the annual rate of rise over the past 20 years has been 0.13 inches (3.2 millimeters) a year, roughly twice the average speed of the preceding 80 years.” Yet that statistic was long ago debunked. In 2011, Nils-Axel Mörner, a sea level expert with decades of experience in the field related how a member of the IPCC admitted to him that satellite data had been fiddled to fit the narrative.	0
It is not just burning up far-away Russia. It’s here now. The seas have warmed. The harbingers of a warming planet and the abruptly shifting weather patterns that result vary across the American landscape. Along the vast Mississippi River drainage in the heartland of America, epic floods, like our wildfires in the West, are becoming more frequent.	1
Courtesy Allie Goldstein and Kirsten Howard This story first appeared on the Atlantic website and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. In March of this year, a Gallup poll highlighted an interesting tension in American thinking on global warming. What the survey didn’t ask was how many people across the country are already reacting to rising temperatures—and preparing for those ahead. This past summer, twenty-somethings Allie Goldstein and Kirsten Howard took a road trip to document stories of what they call “climate resilience”—examples of individuals and communities finding creative ways to adapt to hotter summers, stronger storms, bigger wildfires, rising sea levels, and more.	1
It seems not a week goes by without another “dire warning” about one species or another that will someday be on the verge of collapse because of slightly higher temperatures predicted to exist 100 years from now. This week’s doomed furry friend is the emperor penguin, who researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution say could be nearly wiped out by 2100 because of climate change. Dispersal may help sustain global Emperor penguin populations for a limited time. They say the Emperor penguin should be listed as an endangered species.” The Daily Mail (United Kingdom) reported, “While some species are able to adapt to climate change, melting Antarctic ice will strip emperor penguins of their breeding and feeding grounds, putting their numbers at risk. New research predicts that by the end of the century, emperor penguin populations could decline by up to 99 per cent.” [sic] The theory is based on mathematical models that predict as sea ice in the Antarctic continues to melt, the penguins’ breeding and feeding grounds will shrink to unsustainable levels.	1
And sea level has been increasing… at a steady level since we started recording them. But if the rising sea level is so catastrophic, why has Gore bought a beachfront mansion? Carbon dioxide – what you are exhaling – is what controls temperature. And climate models have constantly reflected that reality. Unfortunately, “it’s the sun, stupid” to paraphrase Bill Clinton.	1
The latest bonkers offering is the assertion by Time author Jeffrey Kluger that climate change will cause more volcanos. “Give climate change credit for one thing: it’s endlessly versatile,” Kluger writes breathlessly in his article How Climate Change Leads to Volcanoes (Really). There was a time we called it global warming, which meant what it said. It was only later that we appreciated that a planet running a fever is just like a person running a fever, which is to say it has a whole lot of other symptoms: in this case, droughts, floods, wildfires, habitat disruption, sea level rise, species loss, crop death and more. “Now, you can add yet another problem to the climate change hit list: volcanoes.	1
A parrotfish swims over a dead coral reef.Wilfredo Lee/AP This story originally appeared in the Guardian and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Most Caribbean coral reefs will disappear within the next 20 years unless action is taken to protect them, primarily due to the decline of grazers such as sea urchins and parrotfish. A comprehensive analysis by 90 experts of more than 35,000 surveys conducted at nearly 100 Caribbean locations since 1970 shows that the region’s corals have declined by more than 50 percent. But restoring key fish populations and improving protection from overfishing and pollution could help the reefs recover and make them more resilient to the impacts of climate change, according to the study from the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the United Nations Environment Program.	1
Gore was recently nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in drawing attention to climate change, while the film 'An Inconvenient Truth' earlier this year won an Oscar. Credit: AFP/Getty Images In his movie Gore predicted that sea levels could rise six meters (20 feet) with the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. The South Pole is gaining more ice than it’s losing. Also a great amount of the losing is due to underground heat. As for Greenland, its melting cycle doesn’t seem to have changed much.	1
Is climate change making wildfires worse? Big wildfires like Colorado’s thrive in dry air, low humidity, and high winds; climate change is going to make those conditions more frequent over the next century. Large forest fires have occurred more often in the western United States since the mid-1980s as spring temperatures increased, snow melted earlier, and summers got hotter, leaving more and drier fuels for fires to devour. Thomas Tidwell, the head of the United States Forest Service, told a Senate committee on energy and natural resources recently that the fire season now lasts two months longer and destroys twice as much land as it did four decades ago. Fires now, he said, burn the same amount of land faster.	0
Climate change is happening – but not because of human activity, Daniel Botkin, professor Emeritus in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology at University of California Santa Barbara has said. Moreover, the focus on man-made global warming is detracting attention from real environmental disasters to nature’s detriment. Writing on the National Parks Traveler, a website dedicated to America’s national parks, Botkin challenges the conclusions reached by the Union of Concerned Scientists in their paper National Landmarks at Risk, How Rising Seas, Floods, and Wildfires Are Threatening the United States’ Most Cherished Historic Sites, not least because they’ve taken the standard reports from the IPCC and others, “treating them as accurate and true,” and then used those results to look at the possible outcome for various national parks. “The point of the report, its opening theme and its major conclusion, is that these historic places are in trouble and it’s our fault, we have been the bad guys interfering with nature and therefore damaging places we value,” Botkin says, before methodically knocking down each assertion as demonstrably false.	2
But that’s just around the corner, said J. Marshall Shepherd, president of the American Meteorological Society. “It’s clear that sometime next year we’ll see 400 consistently,” he said. This will require, at a minimum, slashing the use of fossil fuels. For example, according to Hansen, the world will need to completely stop burning coal by 2030 if returning to 350 ppm is to remain possible. What’s the holdup?	1

They fear that we may be at—and over—a climate change precipice hair-raisingly quickly. Mind you, the more conservative climate science types, represented by the prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), paint scenarios that are only modestly less hair-raising, but let’s spend a little time, as I’ve done, with what might be called scientists at the edge and hear just what they have to say. We as a species have never experienced 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. “We’ve never been on a planet with no Arctic ice, and we will hit the average of 400 ppm…within the next couple of years. At that time, we’ll also see the loss of Arctic ice in the summers…This planet has not experienced an ice-free Arctic for at least the last three million years.” For the uninitiated, in the simplest terms, here’s what an ice-free Arctic would mean when it comes to heating the planet: minus the reflective ice cover on Arctic waters, solar radiation would be absorbed, not reflected, by the Arctic Ocean.	1
Not entirely the “death of global warming” as many have claimed – what happened with Climategate is much more nuanced and exponentially more interesting than the headlines convey. What was triggered at this blog was the death of unconditional trust in the scientific peer review process, and the maturing of a new movement – that of peer-to-peer review. Just what forced the release of the Climategate files – and as a consequence revealed the uncertainty of the science and the co-opting of the process that legitimizes global warming research. It was a collective of climate blogs, centered on the work of Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, which applied the pressure. With moderators and blog commenters that include engineers, PhDs, statistics whizzes, mathematic experts, software developers, and weather specialists – the label flat-earthers, as many of their opponents have attempted to brand them, seems as fitting as tagging Lady Gaga with the label demure.	2
But unless a region undergoes freezing temperatures for several days, says Levetin, once warm weather returns, so will the pollen deluge. While no single weather event—the cold snaps that caused this year’s pollen vortex, for example—can be directly attributed to global warming, the science community is engaged in a lively debate over whether climate change is making unusual weather events, including severe cold temperatures, more likely. The rapidly warming Arctic has caused the jet stream to slow, which could result in atmospheric events, such as winter storms, staying put for longer. But even if climate change can’t be blamed for this year’s pollen vortex, there is substantial evidence that a warming planet spells a more agonizing allergy season. Cold weather may have caused the current pollen backlog, but over the long term, the opposite may be true.	0
The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California at Merced, estimated based on its models “the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent over the 200-year record captured,” according to an article published on the UC Merced website. Photosynthesis is the process of converting carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, which power plants, using sunlight. The leading candidates are rising atmospheric CO2 levels, a result of emissions from human activities; longer growing seasons, a result of climate change caused by CO2 emissions; and nitrogen pollution, another result of fossil fuel combustion and agriculture. In other words, more carbon dioxide, which is being produced by humans at record levels, has improved plant growth, which in turn improves food production for humans and animals. “The rising CO2 level stimulates crops yields,” said lead researcher Elliott Campbell, a professor at UC Merced.	0
No Hope for Averting Catastrophic Climate Change Of all the findings in the 2012 edition of the World Energy Outlook, the one that merits the greatest international attention is the one that received the least. Even if governments take vigorous steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the report concluded, the continuing increase in fossil fuel consumption will result in “a long-term average global temperature increase of 3.6 degrees C.” This should stop everyone in their tracks. An increase of 2 degrees Celsius is about all the planet can accommodate without unimaginably catastrophic consequences: sea-level increases that will wipe out many coastal cities, persistent droughts that will destroy farmland on which hundreds of millions of people depend for their survival, the collapse of vital ecosystems, and far more. An increase of 3.6 degrees C essentially suggests the end of human civilization as we know it. To put this in context, human activity has already warmed the planet by about 0.8 degrees C—enough to produce severe droughts around the world, trigger or intensify intense storms like Hurricane Sandy, and drastically reduce the Arctic ice cap.	0
New regulations on carbon are being brought forward in many countries, such as the US and China, though there have also been withdrawals from climate action, such as the demise of carbon trading in Australia. The Generation report follows the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‘s assessment of current global warming science, which set out a “carbon budget” of how much carbon dioxide we can continue to pump into the atmosphere before triggering dangerous levels of warming. There could be as little as 30 years of burning fossil fuels before the threshold is reached. This suggests that many of the world’s remaining fossil fuel resources must be left unexploited if the climate is not to be put in danger, and prominent scientific and political leaders are increasingly calling for this to be recognized. Gore and Blood’s recommendations could take a decade to complete, the partners admit, but they insist that the first steps at least should be undertaken urgently.	1
Still, it’s not too late to prevent the worst of climate change, says the 840-page report, which the White House is highlighting as it tries to jump-start often stalled efforts to curb heat-trapping gases. However, if the nation and the world don’t change the way they use energy, “we’re still on the pathway to more damage and danger of the type that are described in great detail in the rest of this report,” said study co-author Henry Jacoby, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is the most detailed and U.S.-focused scientific report on global warming. “Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,” the report says. “Corn producers in Iowa, oyster growers in Washington state and maple syrup producers in Vermont are all observing climate-related changes that are outside of recent experience.” The report looks at regional and state-level effects of global warming, compared with recent reports from the United Nations that lumped all of North America together.	1
But after that come regulations for the really big existing polluters—which is where the real emissions cuts could be made. It is hard to understate how big a deal these regulations could be; and while Republicans in the House of Representatives will most assuredly gripe about the EPA’s alleged power grabs, it’s less clear that they can stop them. The science compels action to address the single largest source of carbon pollution in our country. “The clean energy solutions are at hand. And the administration has ample authority to chart a path forward in addressing this dangerous pollution.” 5.	0
"""We&apos;re talking about losing 35 percent of the population of coral in some of these reefs — that&apos;s huge."" The damage is part of a massive bleaching event that has been impacting reefs around the world for the past two years. Bleaching has been triggered by global warming and El Nino, a warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. Hot water puts stress on coral, causing it to turn white and become vulnerable to disease. Other reefs have suffered even more severely from the recent bleaching; Some Pacific islands, for example, have reported coral death rates of more than 80 percent, Eakin said."	0
“By exporting natural gas,” Tillerson told the Asia Society in June 2013, “the United States could shore up the energy security of Asian allies and trading partners and stimulate investment in American domestic production.” Big Energy’s “Humanitarian” Mission In promoting such policies, Exxon’s executives are careful to acknowledge that growing concerns over climate change are generating increased resistance to fossil fuel consumption in Europe and other First World areas. When it comes to the rest of the planet, however, such concerns, they claim, should be outweighed by a “humanitarian” impulse to provide cheap fossil energy to poor people. Tending to the needs of the poor constitutes a greater priority than curbing global warming. “We must also recognize that there is a humanitarian imperative to meeting these growing global energy needs,” Tillerson typically asserted in 2013. Asked why global warming shouldn’t be of greater concern, the Exxon CEO parroted Lomberg’s anti-environmental perspective.	2
"An April 2017 study published in Nature reported that rising global temperatures during the 19th and 20th centuries could be linked to greater plant photosynthesis — which means warmer temperatures, longer growing seasons, and yes, more food. According to the study, ""the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent"" over the 200 years the record reported. There is no proof that global warming is caused by humans, and no proof that global warming will cause catastrophic issues for Earth. Also, various studies have followed the fluctuating average temperature of the earth, and a study in August 2017 reported that the average climate was actually cooler then than it was when Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work in pushing climate change awareness. In March, the Washington Times reported that the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Association fudged numbers to support the agenda of global warming."	2
"""This volume provides the scientific balance that is missing from the overly alarmist reports from the IPCC, which are highly selective in their review of climate science,"" the authors write. The study was done under the auspices of the Heartland Institute, which claims it ""has no formal attachment to or sponsorship from any government or governmental agency."" The big issue in the global warming debate is how large is the human impact on climate. And this report shows that it is very small, that natural variability, the variability that&apos;s caused by natural cycles of the sun and other factors, way outweigh anything the human impact could have."" The report comes in advance of the expected release later this month of a new U.N. report on climate change."	1
Instead of studying the issue for themselves, people rely on the media and the scientists the media has promoted to provide them with scientific conclusions. In other words, to the extent the public believes in the theory humans are responsible for global warming, it's because they trust the scientists and media outlets they hear from most often on this issue, but should they? Over the past three decades, many climate scientists have repeatedly made a number of significant and alarming predictions about global warming, and the vast majority of the time. As Roy Spencer—who earned his Ph.D. in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin in 1981 and previously served as the senior scientist for climate studies at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center—wrote in 2014, greater than 95 percent of the climate models through 2013 “over-forecast the warming trend since 1979.” It’s common for climate alarmists to argue that global warming has caused and will continue to cause a significant increase in extreme weather events, including hurricanes, and that sea levels will eventually rise to the point that massive cities will someday be flooded and uninhabitable, but the available data say otherwise. H. Sterling Burnett, Ph.D., a research fellow specializing in environment and climate issues for The Heartland Institute, where I work as executive editor, wrote in January for Red State, “For instance, climate models predicted more intense hurricanes, but for nearly a decade, the United States has experienced far fewer hurricanes making landfall than the historic average, and those hurricanes that have made landfall have been no more powerful than previously experienced.” “Additionally,” Burnett continued, “while scientists have claimed anthropogenic warming should cause sea levels to rise at increasing rates—because of melting ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica and the thermal expansion of water molecules under warmer conditions—sea-level rise has slowed.	1
It was halting, and hardly eloquent. He seemed rusty talking about the issue, even saying “carbons” at one point instead of “carbon.” But nonetheless, in a White House press conference last Wednesday, President Obama went the furthest he has gone yet in laying out a climate change agenda for his second term. I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. There were few specifics of the sort that climate watchers wanted to hear, however—and they were justly incensed the next day, when White House press secretary Jay Carney dismissed both the notion of a carbon tax, and tying global warming to Superstorm Sandy (actually, the connection is quite clear and unambiguous). Nonetheless, Obama’s halting words reflect a stark political reality: Thanks to Sandy, we’re only now taking baby steps back towards the political traction that we had obtained four years ago, when cap and trade legislation really seemed achievable—before the Category 5 intensification of tea party science denial.	0
The report warns that emissions need to fall by between 40 and 70 percent by 2050 from a 2010 base level, and be “near zero or below in 2100” if disaster is to be averted. Computer models used by the IPCC to predict warming have shown that the best way to achieve negative emissions is through planting billions of trees to soak up CO2, then burning them in plants fitted with carbon capture and storage systems. Global average temperatures would not rise beyond the crucial 2˚C above preindustrial levels threshold, thought to be the tipping point at which irreversible damage would occur. Currently, only one commercial-scale CCS plant has been built: the Boundary Dam project in Canada, at a cost of £750million. Sir Mark Walport, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said: “We can still avoid the most serious impacts.	1
President Obama says its merely an agreement because it is convenient for him to avoid a vote in the Senate where it would most likely fail. But the Paris pact will become legally important when it is time to defend President Obama’s carbon regulation, the so-called Clean Power Plan, before the U.S. Supreme Court. The supposedly non-binding agreement actually gives the EPA legal authority to regulate carbon emissions. The liberal blog ThinkProgress made this exact argument. This “agreement” does not have legal authority at the international level to compel countries to reduce carbon emissions.	1
Global warming has slowed because of measures taken by the government. Verma’s remarks came in response to Viscount Ridley, a Conservative peer who has questioned government efforts to slow global warming. Ridley asked: “The fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change has confirmed in the same words that there has been a hiatus in global warming for at least the last 15 years.	2
The theory of ‘man-made climate change’ is an unsubstantiated hypothesis [about] our climate [which says it] has been adversely affected by the burning of fossil fuels in the last 100 years, causing the average temperature on the earth’s surface to increase very slightly but with disastrous environmental consequences. “The theory is that the CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuel is the ‘greenhouse gas’ causes ‘global warming’ – in fact, water is a much more powerful greenhouse gas and there is 20 time more of it in our atmosphere (around one per cent of the atmosphere) whereas CO2 is only 0.04 per cent. Even the term ‘global warming’ does not mean anything unless you give it a time scale. The temperature of the earth has been going up and down for millions of years, if there are extremes, it’s nothing to do with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it’s not permanent and it’s not caused by us. Global warming is nonsense.” Professor Woodcock dismissed evidence for global warming, such as the floods that deluged large parts of Britain this winter, as “anecdotal” and therefore meaningless in science.	2
For instance, it rode atop the wall of water that Superstorm Sandy pushed inland at New York and New Jersey. And that’s just a tiny fraction of what’s to come. 1.6 degrees Celsius (just under 3 degrees Fahrenheit) of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels might be enough to lock in Greenland’s complete melting. Greenland temperatures in summer have already risen a full degree Celsius since the year 2000, and if the soot-related and biological feedbacks that are Box’s current focus turn out to be big enough, the 1.6 degree threshold might also be too conservative. In other words, Box’s boots-on-the-ground perspective on Greenland suggests that the models might be undershooting things—and all that water may be coming faster still.	0
Among the 150-200 million people estimated to have to flee their homes because of climate change, children will suffer more than adults because of their relative lack of resources and higher vulnerability to disease. In heat-waves, likely to grow more intense and frequent under climate change, babies and small children are more likely to die or suffer heatstroke because they find it difficult to regulate their body heat. Global warming would cause rapid rises in food prices, causing severe consequences in poor countries. In pointed contrast to climate skeptics, who have seized on some of the areas of uncertainty in the IPCC assessment to claim that global warming is a far-off and minor problem, Oxfam listed recent examples of extreme weather that have caused food shortages and raised prices, quoting scientific estimates that these are likely to increase in number as warming continues. “Today one person in eight goes to bed hungry.	0
In July, Bloomberg announced a plan to spend $20 billion on floodgates and other defenses against the rising tides. “Bloomberg has done great work with his recent climate plan, to mitigate the impacts of climate and reduce emissions,” Eric Whalen, a field organizer with Environment New York, said on Tuesday afternoon. The winning candidate will continue Bloomberg’s work to mitigate global warming and increase energy efficiency. During the campaign, he praised Bloomberg’s vision, but cautioned that the city must address the specific needs of low-income residents who suffered the worst effects of Sandy. (De Blasio’s campaign message was a critique of racial and socioeconomic inequality and injustice during the Bloomberg years: He opposed the excessive use of police tactics such as “stop and frisk,” and bemoaned the lack of affordable housing and consequent loss of diversity.)	1
Right? Keep that historical buzz going for a moment to contemplate five sites the National Trust for Historic Preservation—the country’s preserver-in-chief—thinks are most vulnerable to flooding caused by sea level rise. No comprehensive models yet exist to address sea level rise and its threat to historic landmarks. That’s bad, says Anthony Veerkamp, a program director with the Trust, because without first taking stock of what we might lose, “inevitably there will be adaptation strategies that do lesser or greater harm to historic resources.” Here are five sites the Trust are most worried about: 1. San Francisco’s Embarcadero California’s Bay Area can expect sea levels to rise by up to 55 inches by the end of the century, putting an estimated 270,000 people and $62 billion worth of San Francisco urban bling at risk of increased flooding.	1
A new state-commissioned report on the effect of global warming (a.k.a. The impacts on the California coastline could be disproportionate, with local sea levels rising 1.25 feet for every one-foot increase caused by melting ice in West Antarctica. There is a 67% probability that the mean rise in the San Francisco Bay could fall in a range between one and 2.4 feet if action is taken to slow climate change, and 1.6-3.4 feet if none is taken, the report says. The San Francisco Chronicle uses the term “catastrophic” to describe that rise, although that term is not used by the report itself.	1
"Appealing for a new citizen activism in the free world, President Barack Obama renewed his call Wednesday to reduce U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles and to confront climate change, a danger he called ""the global threat of our time."" (Photo: AP/dpa,Marcus Brandt) Obama said the United States is taking the lead in terms of renewable energy. Carbon emissions are down. A recovering U.S. economy, meanwhile, means energy consumption is on the rise and with that comes greater concerns about environmental well-being. Storms like so-called Superstorm Sandy, he said, are the face of the new environmental future."	1
"Happer, who has advised President Donald Trump on climate issues, said. ""Carbon dioxide is a perfectly natural gas, it’s just like water vapor, it’s something that plants love. They grow better with more carbon dioxide, and you can see the greening of the earth already from the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Nye hit back and said Happer didn't understand the ""rate,"" or speed at which carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere. Then he ripped CNN for not having only climate change alarmists on their network."	2
McPherson, who maintains the blog Nature Bats Last, added, “We’ve never been here as a species and the implications are truly dire and profound for our species and the rest of the living planet.” While his perspective is more extreme than that of the mainstream scientific community, which sees true disaster many decades into our future, he’s far from the only scientist expressing such concerns. Professor Peter Wadhams, a leading Arctic expert at Cambridge University, has been measuring Arctic ice for 40 years, and his findings underscore McPherson’s fears. The fall-off in ice volume is so fast it is going to bring us to zero very quickly. According to current data, he estimates “with 95 percent confidence” that the Arctic will have completely ice-free summers by 2018. (US Navy researchers have predicted an ice-free Arctic even earlier—by 2016.)	0
When my editors assigned me to fact check Kate Sheppard’s feature “Under Water,” part of my task was to come up with accompanying visuals that would illustrate how sea level rise could destroy coastal cities as we know them. Initially, I set out looking for flood maps of the entire Eastern Seaboard with apocalyptic illustrations of the Atlantic crashing against the foothills of the Appalachians. Sea level rise measured in the course of our lifetime isn’t a matter of miles, but of feet. Wait, I thought. A few feet?	1
His studies showed the continent was heating up faster than the rest of the globe, and this warming would plague an already insecure continent with more severe and more frequent droughts and famines. Chris Funk, a leading climate researcher on Eastern Africa, predicted this drought before it happened. The region’s increasingly drastic droughts are caused, at least in part, by global warming trends affecting the entire planet. The Huffington Post reported: Funk, as well as others in his field, saw the potential for trouble in Somalia long before everyone else did. And he has come to the conclusion that back-to-back droughts that have devastated Somalia in the past year are likely part of a larger trend connected to global warming.	0
For example, left-wing website ThinkProgress wrote in 2012, “Although the vast ice sheets of the frozen continent are remote from almost all of human civilization, their warming has drastic implications for billions of people. With the melting of those almost inconceivable reserves of ice, the planet’s sea levels are rising. Total ice accumulation on Antarctica has outweighed losses. All that is about to change. A study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment in February is now getting the attention of prominent climate change skeptics.	1
“The traditional answer is: We can’t say anything about just one event,” Hayhoe said. With this report, “we can say a little bit more than that now.” Hayhoe, along with an international team of scientists, discovered that climate change will disrupt fire patterns across over 80 percent of the globe by the end of the century. There’s no question that humans have altered the background atmosphere on a global scale. “And there’s also no question humans have altered the environment on the local and regional level” by living near forests and choosing how to manage them. “Climate change is often the final straw in a lot of those cases.” A University of Arizona report from 2006 found that large forest fires occurred more frequently in the Western United States since the mid-1980s as spring temperatures increased, snow melted earlier, and summers got hotter, and that the fire season has grown.	0
"However, there are potentially huge consequences to allowing an overshoot [of those targets]. A warmer climate for even a limited period could profoundly alter meteorological and ecological systems—changes which could perhaps even restrict the ability to produce the biomass on which we might be reliant to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide content,” he said. Reducing carbon emissions to zero could be a major challenge, given the track record of previous efforts to cut carbon. window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={""beacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""licenseKey"":""949ceaf672"",""applicationID"":""42428067"",""transactionName"":""MQZWYhAFXhdYAUBfWwhMdVUWDV8KFhFdWFMTD1VE"",""queueTime"":0,""applicationTime"":118,""atts"":""HUFBFFgfTUgbAxYMTxse"",""errorBeacon"":""bam.nr-data.net"",""agent"":""""}"	1
(Well, New York did empanel a sea level rise task force, which put out a report—and you can see how that turned out.) But it’s not just about what we knew—it’s also what we know going forward. If you think this is bad, well, global warming will make it still worse in the future. Take a recent Nature study by climate scientists at MIT and Princeton, looking at future storm surge scenarios under climate change. The researchers used multiple computer model runs to simulate a variety of storm surges hurled at New York City—explicitly looking at future climate and sea level rise scenarios.	0
The intensification of climate change means that we need to acknowledge the chaotic future we face and start planning for it. Think of what’s coming, if you will, as a kind of storm socialism. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide beyond 350 parts-per-million (ppm) could set off compounding feedback loops and so lock us into runaway climate change. We are already at 392 ppm. Even if we stopped burning all fossil fuels immediately, the disruptive effect of accumulated CO2 in the atmosphere is guaranteed to hammer us for decades.	0
"In fact, human beings have only been industrialized for a tiny fraction of human history, and we've been driving cars for an even tinier fraction. We can know, therefore, that temperatures and weather conditions have swung dramatically from one side of the spectrum to the other and back again, and, from a historical perspective, when comparing 200 years of industrialization to the 4 billion years the Earth's been around, almost all of the warming and cooling happened before any factory was ever built. CO2 emmissions are dwarfed by the immense amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by natural (and evil, likely Republican) sources like oceans and vegetation. We can further know that the Sun -- which is big enough to eat a million Earths, and hot enough to make you burst into flames from millions of miles away -- really calls the shots in our solar system. If we're searching for ""global warming"" culprits, we might want to look at that 27,000,000 degree ball of gas in the sky."	2
It lets you dive into all kinds of data in a clean interface. Next, you’ll want to follow the right people and institutions: Meteorologist Jeff Masters is talking about the ice that’s hitting Georgia as I write. Today’s ice storm is likely to be more damaging than the January 2000 ice storm, which caused $48 million in losses in north Georgia. “However, it will not compare to the damage from the most expensive ice storm in US history, the great February 1994 Southeast US ice storm. That storm killed nine people and caused $4.7 billion (2013 dollars) of damage.” So is Eric Holthaus, who has some sad possibilites in his post on the storm, including that Atlanta could lose one-quarter of its trees.	1
Sea levels have always risen between ice ages or during interglacial periods. Indeed, sea levels have risen more than 400 feet since the end of the last interglacial period. Skeptics reject the claim global temperatures have risen in recent decades. Virtually everyone agrees temperatures have increased, the primary issue is the reason or reasons for those increases. Climate-change alarmists say humans are to blame, and skeptics believe, to varying degrees, humans’ responsibility is relatively minimal or nonexistent.	1
“I don’t think the American public has gripped in its gut what could happen,” Chu told the Los Angeles Times then. “We’re looking at a scenario where there’s no more agriculture in California.” NASA has been keeping tabs on California’s disappearing snow melt, a critical resource for the crops, while USDA researchers are racing to breed stoicism into the water-loving leafy greens. Global warming over the next several decades will take place irrespective of any action taken today. Mou told Mother Jones by email that it takes 10 years to develop new breeds, but that becomes less feasible when crops are being starved of their genetic diversity—a situation in turn accelerated by climate change. His team, which has identified some heat and drought tolerant strains, expects to publish results of their tinkering by early 2014.	0
One may well wonder when “almost certainly” entered scientific jargon. One may also wonder how no climate scientist was able to predict Hurricane Harvey and yet once it happens they know “almost certainly” that it was aggravated by “human-caused warming.” Fortunately, there are other—more modest—climate scientists who are willing to acknowledge just how much science cannot tell us about climate. Attributing specific climatic events to global warming is simply dishonest. “It is a fundamental fact, although increasingly ignored, that no single climate event or location can be attributed to global warming,” Thresher said. “There is simply no valid way to prove a connection and correlation is not causation.” According to Thresher, relying on simple correlation leads to absurd conclusions like the following: “As global warming has supposedly been occurring, the average human lifespan has significantly increased.	2
Indeed, satellite records of temperatures not only show no increase of temperatures for the past 18 years – climate models have nearly all failed at predicting trends – but 2014 isn’t even hot for that period. Plus, when looking at a larger picture the modern warm period is nothing compared to what human civilization has lived before. The Arctic see would be ice-free this year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also gives a lot of attention to the “unprecedented” melting of the North Pole. However, Arctic ice is at a 10-year peak and is now within the standard deviation of the satellite-era average, which started in 1979.	1
According to an alarming new report by a U.N. panel of scientists, humans have just 12 years to get their ecological affairs in order before the environment — and climate change — hits a critical tipping point. The report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that humans have just 12 years to make huge leaps in innovations to reduce global warming to less extreme levels — or suffer major consequences, Vox reported. The earth is headed for devastating effects of climate change, including deadly flooding, extreme drought, food shortages, the death of coral reefs, and more extreme weather events. The report notes that the earth's surface has warmed about 1 degree Celsius since the pre-industrial period (prior to the Industrial Revolution). If emissions continue at this rate, according to scientists, the earth could see a further increase that would put total warming at 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels sometime between 2030 and 2052.	0
Arctic sea ice After decreasing in the Arctic for a period and increasing in the Antarctic it now appears to be stabilizing. But so what? The behavior of arctic sea ice represents one of the numerous interesting phenomena that the earth presents us with, and for which neither the understanding nor the needed records exist. It probably pays to note that melting sea ice does not contribute to sea level rise. Moreover, man has long dreamt of the opening of this Northwest Passage.	1
In one part of the world or another, there are always going to be food shortages, political unrest, and problems related to agriculture. In the United States, long before the presence of “global warming,” Americans faced significant hardship in large part because of the severe droughts of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, a major contributor to the Great Depression. The presence of additional carbon dioxide has actually led to better plant growth and crop yields throughout much of the world, including in Africa. In April, The Blaze reported a study published in the journal Nature showed “the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent” during the 19th and 20th centuries, periods of significant warming, with the “leading candidates” of the increased plant growth being “rising atmospheric CO2 levels, a result of emissions from human activities; longer growing seasons, a result of climate change caused by CO2 emissions; and nitrogen pollution, another result of fossil fuel combustion and agriculture.” “The rising CO2 level stimulates crops yields,” said lead researcher of the Nature study Elliott Campbell, a professor at the University of California at Merced. In May, leading climate researcher Patrick Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, wrote in an article he hypothesizes the reason one recent study showed substantial amounts of forest cover in global drylands had gone uncounted in previous studies on the subject is because significant growth has occurred in recent years due to higher amounts of carbon dioxide.	2
Climate predictions used by scientists, forecasters, and academics have wildly overestimated global warming, forecasting on average two times more warming than actually occurred. As Fox News reports, a study in the science journal Nature Climate Change “compared 117 climate predictions made in the 1990s to the actual amount of warming.” And out of those 117 predictions, according to the study’s author, “three were roughly accurate and 114 overestimated the amount of warming. On average, the predictions forecasted two times more global warming than actually occurred.” John Christy, a professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, told Fox News that he “looked at 73 climate models going back to 1979 and every single one predicted more warming than happened in the real world.” Many of these “overestimations also made their way into the popular press.” For instance, the Associated Press in 1989 reported, “Using computer models, researchers concluded that global warming would raise average annual temperatures nationwide 2 degrees by 2010.” Such articles then became the launching point for many other stories in local papers and national newscasts.	2
When it comes online later this year, Kemper will be the first power plant in the US capable of capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions. The EPA says the Kemper County Energy Facility offers a real-life example that it is possible to go on burning the dirtiest of fossil fuels and still make the cuts in carbon dioxide emissions needed to avoid a climate catastrophe. Carbon capture is an unproven technology. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are moving votes to overturn the entire set of EPA climate rules, based on the argument that carbon capture technology still does not work, and on Wednesday the house of representatives’ science committee is looking at CCS technology. The 582 megawatt facility is expected to burn through around 4 million tonnes of low-grade lignite coal a year, all mined from the hills just behind the plant.	1
A further 3,000 were killed by flooding in eastern India in 2004, and 2,400 thanks to monsoon rains in 2008. By comparison, the only flooding event in the Western world since the year 2000 was the New Orleans levee disaster of 2005, in which 69 people lost their lives. The best protection against natural disaster is economic development, which allows countries to build flood defences, reinforced buildings, medical care and food stores. In the conclusion to his book Let Them Eat Carbon, Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers’ Alliance commented “Instead of trying to control emissions by rationing energy and thereby limiting economic growth, we should bet on more growth and human ingenuity. “Most importantly [we should] go for growth to produce more resilient societies better able to respond to whatever the world throws at them.”	1
In a study published in 2011, however, researchers at the University of Michigan actually found that Republicans seem to be more willing to accept the reality of the problem when the “climate change” label was used. Most recently, however—and as Media Matters documents in the helpful video below—conservatives have seized on the bizarre idea that the environmental movement is now saying “climate change” because it can explain anything, including “decades of global cooling,” as one Fox News host claimed. This a sneaky way to cover up the reality that global warming is a sham. Here at Climate Desk, we’ve used the terms pretty much interchangeably. So have scientists.	2
Fifty-five million years ago, a five degree Celsius rise in average global temperatures seems to have occurred in just 13 years, according to a study published in the October 2013 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A report in the August 2013 issue of Science revealed that in the near-term Earth’s climate will change 10 times faster than at any other moment in the last 65 million years. The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. “There are potential irreversible effects of melting the Arctic sea ice. If it begins to allow the Arctic Ocean to warm up, and warm the ocean floor, then we’ll begin to release methane hydrates.	0
Emissions from livestock account for 14.5% of all human-caused greenhouse gases, according to the UN. It estimates that this could be cut by nearly a third through better farming practices. One of the most effective ways to cut methane is to reduce global populations of ruminant livestock, especially cattle. The scientists say not enough attention has been paid to tackling greenhouse gases other than CO2, especially in the ongoing UN climate talks, which last convened in Warsaw in November. The only way the world could avoid dangerous tipping points as temperatures rise would be by cutting methane emissions as well as CO2 emissions from sources such as energy and transport, they argue.	1
"Each of us emits about two pounds of carbon dioxide a day, so are we polluting the planet?"" Happer, who has advised President Donald Trump on climate issues, said. Carbon dioxide is a perfectly natural gas. They grow better with more carbon dioxide, and you can see the greening of the earth already from the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"" he explained. Nye hit back and said Happer didn't understand the ""rate,"" or speed at which carbon dioxide is entering the atmosphere."	2
But in practice, even middle-of-the-road policy ideas have had trouble succeeding politically. Mr. Bauman, the economist in Salt Lake City, found that out when he spearheaded an unsuccessful attempt to pass a carbon tax in Washington State in 2016. In the end, creating a clean economy will require a blend of policies, not just carbon taxes. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Martin Hayden of the group Earthjustice, which supports the Green New Deal’s vision, says voters should think not just about the costs of reducing emissions, but also about the much larger costs of environmental damage if climate change goes unaddressed.	1
"Watson says that ""special attention and conservation actions"" will be needed to help support any migration that may take place in the coming decades. But ultimately, she says, the salt marshes may need to see the effects of human-caused climate change reversed, or at least slowed, in order to protect the struggling ecosystems on a large scale. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the most important factor, because wetlands can naturally adapt to lower rates of sea level rise. ""So slowing sea level rise due to climate change would be really beneficial."""	0
"The effects of warming global temperatures are already being felt in the Antarctic, says Stephen Price, a meltwater researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. ""Ice shelves are very flat, and essentially lie at sea level. So a small increase in temperature at sea level can translate to an increase in temperature over a very large area of an ice shelf. ""If temperatures at sea level are already near the melting point, then small increases in temperature could lead to huge areas of the surface of ice shelves that were previously frozen becoming melted, for at least part of the year.""

“We haven’t seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models. We haven’t seen that in the observations,” Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford and one of the study’s authors, told the Times of London, as reported in The Independent. Another 240 billion tons of carbon emissions can be tolerated. “That’s about 20 years of emissions before temperatures are likely to cross 1.5C,” Allen said. “It’s the difference between being not doable and being just doable.” Michael Grubb, a professor of international energy and climate change at University College London, and a co-author of the study, said two years ago at the Paris summit that “All the evidence from the past 15 years leads me to conclude that actually delivering 1.5C is simply incompatible with democracy.” But this week he told The Times: “When the facts change, I change my mind, as [John Maynard] Keynes said.	1
To some extent, he thinks social media – and the farther reach it gives to disasters – has helped that rise. “There’s a sense of intimacy with these impending storms that wasn’t around 10 or 15 or 20 years ago,” he says. Such planning can sometimes rely on scientific projections, like sea-level rise, that is politicized. In the past, he says people who were skeptical were sometimes shouted down in meetings and simply left. “Now, those conversations are being more frank and real about the assumptions and uncertainties involved, and those voices are starting to come back to the table,” he says.	1
Unfortunately, according to an article published in Nature last year, it seems unlikely that the world will be able to achieve the 2 degrees Celsius cap outlined by the Paris Agreement. The paper stated that there was only a 5% chance that global temperatures will only increase by 2 degrees celsius and will instead likely rise 3.2 degrees Celsius (and possibly by up to 4.9 degrees Celsius) by 2100. If the global temperature did reach an increase of 4 degrees Celsius, this would result in GDP losses of $159 billion a year. Kompas says that this equates to losses of approximately $5,000 for every Australian, every year. However, Australia may get off lightly compared to other regions – the study found that poorer countries will ultimately be the hardest hit by the effects of climate change.	1
The panel recommended pouring billions more dollars into research and development of cleaner energy resources, and stated failure to act will produce turbulent 21st century weather extremes, as well as spread drought and disease, expand oceans, displace costal populations. The report, the result of a two-year study, was compiled by an 18-member group of scientists representing 11 nations. Global warming is most likely caused by human activity. Also yesterday, a group of developing nations known as the Group of 77 said wealthy countries must take responsibility for causing climate change instead of laying the blame on others. Munir Akram, Pakistan’s U.N. ambassador and chair of the Group of 77, said though emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants are increasing in booming Asian countries like China and India, quote, “most of the environmental degradation has historically been caused by the industrial world.” Francesca Grifo and Brenda Ekwurzel join us now.	0
In 2004, fires in Alaska released 51.5 million tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of an entire year’s worth of emissions from the nation’s airline industry, according to analysis by Eric Kasischke, a professor of biogeography at the University of Maryland and co-author of the study. Far greater stores of carbon remain trapped in soil and peat layers across the Northern hemisphere, from Canada to Siberia — an amount equal to all the carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere. But the significant warming of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions in recent decades are drying out these usually moist soil layers. “What we’re seeing is an increased frequency, over the last 10 or 20 years, of severe fire,” Dr. Turetsky said. “A few degrees of warming dries these systems out considerably and makes them much more vulnerable to burning.” How are climate change, scarcer resources, population growth and other challenges reshaping society?	0
For one thing, not every disaster can be linked to climate change. Debating which storm fits under that umbrella, and which is simply a matter of typical weather fluctuation, does little to help communities cope with either type of storm. Approaching such policy decisions through the less controversial lenses of resilience, risk, adaptation, and disaster preparedness can be a portal to the tougher – and more politically fraught – conversation about mitigation and carbon emissions. “If you start with resilience, there’s so much learning that takes place through that process,” says Michelle Wyman, executive director of the National Council for Science and the Environment, a Washington-based nonprofit that works to improve the scientific basis for environmental decisionmaking. A conversation about flood planning might start at a local level, she explains, and bring in existing data.	1
"“Companies [in this Partnership] analyse sources of methane to evaluate cost-effective technologies for methane emissions reduction,” according to a 2015 Sustainability Report the company provided to the Monitor. “From the natural gas production system, there do seem to be leaks coming from … relatively few sources,” meaning emissions could be lowered substantially with each fixed leak, Greenblatt tells the Monitor. Identifying and addressing these ""super-emitters"" could reduce methane emissions from fossil fuels up to 87 percent. To make that happen, President Obama’s aspirational goal to reduce methane by 40 to 45 percent “needs to become a policy with teeth,” he concludes. Joeri Rogelj, a research scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, tells the Monitor that easy solutions to the additional emissions, such as curbing leakage, may paradoxically “make achieving emissions-reduction harder in the long term, because of the lock-in to emission intensive infrastructure.” If countries are not compelled to make structural changes now, they may struggle to do so down the road."	1
The Chinese Communist Party realizes that the one thing that could pose a threat is uncontrolled air pollution because you’d have demonstrations and riots due to people concerned about their kids not being able to breathe. It’s a very sensitive and important political issue. We can see what the new economy would look like: solar and wind energy replacing fossil fuels. The great thing about solar energy is how much you use today has no effect on how much is available tomorrow. You can’t say that with coal and oil.	1
"How do tech companies emit this much carbon dioxide? The Internet relies on millions of physical servers in data centers around the world, connected by undersea cables, switches, and routers, all requiring a great deal of energy to run. Internet activity results in as much carbon emissions as the global aviation industry. Google has released reports about its carbon footprint, and has designed more energy-efficient data centers, invested in clean energy, and has launched numerous carbon-offset programs. The company's spokesperson told Quartz that Google has been ""carbon neutral"" since 2007."	1
The Keystone XL pipeline, if approved, would cut global oil prices. For many on the left, that’s the bad news. The official U.S. State Department estimate of carbon released by production of Canadian tar sands in connection with the Keystone XL pipeline was between a million and 27 million tons per year.	1
"""The one thing all of us have a responsibility to do is to recognize that climate change is here, it's real,"" Huckabee stated at the Clean Air Cool Planet conference in Manchester, NH. ""What we have to do is stop pointing fingers about who's at fault and saying whose responsibility it is to fix it and recognize it's all our fault and it's all our responsibility to fix it."" I also support cap and trade of carbon emissions. ""And I was disappointed that the Senate rejected a carbon counting system to measure the sources of emissions, because that would have been the first and the most important step toward implementing true cap and trade."" I think that Republicans have made a big mistake by not being more on the forefront of conservation."	0
"Surrounded by several of Hawaii's elected officials Tuesday, Gov. David Ige signed two bills that will expand ""strategies and mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions statewide"" and find ways to better capture and store ""atmospheric carbon dioxide to mitigate climate change,"" a process known as carbon sequestration. Hawaii is committed to environmental stewardship, and we look forward to working with other states to fight global climate change. The two laws incorporate sections of the Paris agreement, giving the state ""legal basis to continue adaptation and mitigation strategies for Hawai‘i, despite the federal government’s withdrawal from the treaty,” State Sen. Majority Leader J. Kalani English, who introduced one of the bills, said in a statement."	0
Monmouthshire MP and climate realist David Davies crashed today’s parliamentary launch of the Committee on Climate Change’s new report and used the opportunity to ask some awkward questions. Short periods of minor global warming could be considered significant, while similar periods of cooling or stagnation could be ignored by the scientific community. Describing the meeting chaired by green energy tycoon Lord Deben, Davies said: “…it was a great big love-in, with about 150 Greens. So I got up and asked why it was not one single scientist could explain how much of the small amount of warming that has taken place was natural – especially given now even the MET office even seems to accept there was a little ice age.	1
The agreement commits almost 200 countries to reducing their use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) over the next 30 years. These compounds – most often used in refrigerators and air conditioners – are the world’s fastest-growing greenhouse gases. Cutting the artificial pollutants, which have a warming effect 1,600 times more powerful than carbon dioxide on average, would be a straightforward step toward meeting the Paris Agreement goal to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Now, with the meetings in Kigali concluded, attention has turned to implementation. One possible obstacle to curbing HFC use: the US Senate.	0
“We as humans are built to look at and respond to the short term.” That’s why, anytime she talks to the public, she not only includes the facts, figures, and indicators, but also two central ideas: how climate change is affecting people in the places they live, already, and what attractive solutions – particularly ones that are also good economically – are already being implemented. “The two biggest myths are, it doesn’t matter to me, and there’s nothing we can do to fix it,” says Hayhoe. Indicators like carbon dioxide levels or global temperature are most useful when they’re put in the right context. “A random factoid that suggests the world is going to hell in a handbasket, or that it’s going there even faster than we thought, is likely to raise some people’s anxiety levels, but not likely to help them think about what options they have for doing something about it,” says Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication. He likes to think about such numbers as metrics, rather than milestones, and put them in a context that helps people see solutions.	1
And what we need to do instead is have those emissions sharply declining over the next fifty years, and that can be done. The technologies either exist or are in the advanced stages of development to get that done. The moment we put real limits and real charges on carbon dioxide emissions, we will see a surge of innovation that will discover even better ways for reducing those emissions. The notion that this is going to be unaffordable and an economic catastrophe to address this problem is just wrong. AMY GOODMAN: How dangerous was it to this country and the world that the US unsigned Kyoto, that President Bush would not sign the Kyoto treaty?	0
Am I being cynical here or do you get the impression that none of these people or organisations (save, obviously, that eager reporter from the Guardian) believes remotely in the Climate Change Fairy any more. But they feel they have to pay lip service to her existence, nonetheless, because custom and form require it. There is next to no scientific evidence anywhere to back up their doomsday predictions of catastrophic man-made global warming. So desperate are they, in fact, that they’re even resorting to saying stuff that is the exact opposite of true, like this recent headline in the Observer (the Guardian‘s Sunday sister paper). OMG…Greenland’s ice sheets are melting fast Would you guess from that headline that Greenland’s ice sheet was experiencing some kind of melting crisis due to global warming?	2
What scientists don&apos;t know is how much they store. This is a problem because scientists can&apos;t predict how much extra carbon would escape into the atmosphere if a forest was destroyed or if planting new trees would be enough to offset the emissions. One of the most poorly quantified components of the carbon cycle is the net balance between forest disturbance and regrowth. GEDI&apos;s lidar instrument works by shooting streams of light particles at the Earth that then reflect back and are picked up by a detector. The time it takes the particles to reach Earth and bounce back is converted into a distance.	1
“I agree with the consensus view that combustion of fossil fuels is a leading cause for increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,” he wrote to Cardin. “I understand these gases to be a factor in rising temperature, but I do not believe the scientific consensus supports their characterization as the ‘key’ factor.” In reality, the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that synthesized thousands of climate studies to examine the physics behind a warming atmosphere concluded that increased carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning coal, oil, and natural gas, caused the “largest contribution” to global warming, followed by other greenhouse gases that are likewise emitted by human industry. Carbon dioxide contributes to warming. “Many people in the press, when they wrote about his statements at the hearing, interpreted it as, ‘Hey, this guy thinks climate change is happening,’” Leiserowitz told BuzzFeed News. “He’s got a view that seems to be quite different than his boss, and that became the storyline.” During the hearing, Tillerson also echoed another Exxon position on the Paris Agreement, a global accord under which most of the world’s nations agreed to voluntarily curb greenhouse gas emissions through 2030 to help hold the global rise in temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.	0
Very few media figures or politicians are going to read the full report – they generally make do with the summary. In this case, the summary wasn’t merely “sexed up” to fool gullible reporters and politicians; it actually direct contradicts the full U.N report in places. Global warming might increase the chances of violent conflict. It’s more likely that sustained conflict leads to poor environmental stewardship than the reverse. These hijinks already led one of the report’s contributors, Professor Richard Tol of Sussex University, to refuse to sign the final product, because he was uncomfortable with the tone of hysteria in the report summary.	0
Two members of the Union of Concerned Scientists join us to talk about what it will take to move past climate change denial and bring about meaningful policy change. [includes rush transcript] AMY GOODMAN: The issue of global warming has been in the news a lot recently. The global warming debate is over. It presented a detailed report to the United Nations to combat global climate change. The panel recommended pouring billions more dollars into research and development of cleaner energy resources, and stated failure to act will produce turbulent 21st century weather extremes, as well as spread drought and disease, expand oceans, displace costal populations.	2
Natural things decay, of course, but they also grow.” The idea that cutting down forests would result in a net reduction of emissions is “crazy,” Dr Phillips added. “The need is to reduce deforestation.” Beverly Law, a professor of forest science at Oregon State University, found another hole in Mr. Rohrabacher’s logic. Roughly 75 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions from the natural world come not from above-ground biomass, but from the soil. “You don’t even want to give this guy another wacky idea, but he forgot about soil,” Dr. Law said. How are climate change, scarcer resources, population growth and other challenges reshaping society?	1
But we can’t say that any particular weather event is the result of climate change. What we can say is that it’s precisely this kind of event which the people have been warning against climate change have been warning about. If there is warming, global warming we are going to see a lot more storms and there will be a lot more violent when they occur. Now, of course, this is caused enormous grief and upset and damage to people in the United States but at the same time as that’s been going on, there’s been some far graver things happening in other parts of the world. We have seen enormous damage caused by floods in Bangladesh, with many, many thousands of people pushed out of their homes by those floods and a great deal of disease caused and malnutrition caused by them at the same time.	1
"Harris notes that our current conservation and management techniques may not be enough to battle these changes. ""Of the six case studies, some of them could have perhaps been helped with some management intervention, although equally one of the lessons which is a little bit frightening is that potentially it's a little bit out of our hands."" The only way this can be addressed is to act quickly and reduce carbon emissions. ""The faster we can get greenhouse gas emissions down, the lower [the] ultimate increase in temperature. It really is a matter of sooner rather than later."""	0
Consistent with previous simulations, part of the West Antarctic ice basin in the authors’ model becomes unstable after carbon emissions reach 600 to 800 gigatons. In one projected event, large parts of the ice sheet melt and drain into the ocean over the next millennia, raising global sea levels by several tens of meters. If global warming did not exceed the 2 degree Celsius benchmark, the millennial sea-level rise from the melting of Antarctic ice could likely be restricted to a few meters. And if all currently available fossil fuel resources were released, the model shows the Antarctic Ice Sheet melting entirely. It is unclear whether this mega-meltdown would be reversible, and on what timescales, the authors note.	1
Hansen's paper, authored with several former NASA colleagues, warns that Earth's climate-regulating systems may be more sensitive to higher levels of carbon than scientists previously suspected. They also calculated the atmospheric changes that would be produced by burning off the estimated stock of Earth's fossil fuel reserves, finding that it would result in a planetary apocalypse. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize adaptation to climate change. Such a scenario, with average temperatures rising 16 degrees Celsius on land and 30 degrees Celsius at the poles, would leave just a fraction of humanity clinging to life atop Earth's highest ridges, Hansen et. al.	0
But proponents, who applaud the senate’s vote, say there is no hypocrisy. “It is not hypocritical to use fossil fuels in order to try to get ourselves off of fossil fuels, particularly since this is simply unavoidable!” David Frank, NYU assistant professor of environmental studies, told FoxNews.com by email earlier this week. Divestment will not noticeably hurt oil company stocks because, when a university sells its fossil-fuel stock and the price falls, independent traders see that the stock has become undervalued and snap it up. But supporters say their goal is simply to send a message. “The point is not really to devalue the stock, rather to make a statement to those companies, our students, and those who might be paying attention (including you!)	1
"""Donald Trump's choice of outspoken climate (change) denier Kevin Cramer to advise him on energy policy is just the latest piece of evidence that letting him get near the White House would put our children's health and futures at risk,"" said campaign spokesman Jesse Ferguson. Trump has been light on the details of his energy policy, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were president. Global warming is a concept ""created by and for the Chinese"" to hurt U.S. business. Clinton, meanwhile, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies ""out of business."" 'NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS' Trump also took heat on Friday for not releasing his tax returns, something that American presidential candidates have done for decades."	2
A new global report from scientists amounts to an urgent call for the world to act more quickly and forcefully to counter fast-rising threats from climate change. Humanity’s window for action is quickly closing, if the goal of holding global warming to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial averages is to be met. And the report emphasized the benefits of aiming for that target, rather than allowing temperatures to rise 2 degrees C or more due to the buildup of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. For coral reefs, for example, that half a degree could be the difference between a huge decline and a near-total loss of those ecosystems, the report estimated.	0
If the bleaching is severe enough, coral can die from a lack of the energy and oxygen that the algae provide. “This is a tragedy not only for some of the world’s most biodiverse coral reefs, but also for people in the region, many of whom are extremely impoverished and depend on these reefs for their food and livelihoods,” Caleb McClennen, marine program director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in a statement. Steadily warming seas pose a similar threat to reefs in other areas. This year bleaching events were recorded in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and other parts of Indonesia. “We are in a major heating period; it’s breaking all records, and there are very furious worries now about the Philippines and eventually Taiwan and probably southern Japan,” Clive Wilkinson, of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network in Australia, said in an interview with The Associated Press.	0
Seems like doing something about global warming might not be so expensive after all. Enjoy the cartoon, stay safe and check out the links behind the ‘toon. The science is anything but settled on global warming. He says that dissenting conclusions are being suppressed by the corrupting influence of taxpayer dollars going into the hands of people who are now fudging the temperature numbers. Of course the last two winters should tell us all we need to know and explain why tens of thousands of scientists think climate change is a hoax.	2
"""Svalbard is a very good spot to show what's happening in the Arctic at the moment,"" he said, noting that each of the past 73 months has been warmer than average. The rising temperatures in the Arctic are affecting permafrost and snow cover as well as the amount of sea ice, which this year was the second-lowest on record. The sea ice is building up much slower than normal as winter approaches. ""There are still huge areas in the Barents Sea and Kara Sea to the east of Svalbard that are free of ice,"" he said. ""They should normally be ice-covered."""	1
More than 10% of the country's ice sheet melted this week. By Claudia Koerner Posted on April 13, 2016, at 9:41 p.m. ET Water is seen on the Glacial Ice Sheet that covers about 80% of Greenland in July 2013.	1
"More Americans are concerned about climate change than ever, with about 7 in 10 of people saying they are ""somewhat worried"" about global warming, according to a polling results released January by climate communication experts at Yale University and George Mason University. The poll found nearly half of Americans believe climate change is harming the US right now. Climate impacts are playing out across the US, from damaging wildfires to increased heavy rain and flooding to rising seas. “We’re the first generation to feel the sting of climate change. And we’re the last who can do something about it,” Inslee said in his launch video."	0
No signal had emerged in the atmosphere to suggest a sharp rise in methane emissions from the Arctic. But that does not mean all is stable with methane in the air — quite the contrary, in fact. It’s true that methane was stable for roughly a decade ending in 2006.	1
And from my perspective, the really critical thing is that we get a handle on the emissions growth so that we can slow it rapidly and turn the corner, so that we’re looking at a period of decreased emissions moving into the future. AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask not only about what’s happening in the Southwest, but a vicious cycle you talked about that could do everything from ignite tropical forests to melt the Arctic tundra. Once warming reaches a certain point, the amount of assistance that we’re getting in terms of carbon storage from the land and oceans tends to go down. And this is quite clear from the IPCC models, and it’s clear from a number of other more recent lines of work. In the IPCC, the models characterize a future in which tropical forests at the high range of warming have a potential to release large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere.	0
Global leaders finally address the climate crisis. The actor and environmental activist was recently nominated by the United Nations to receive the prestigious “Messenger of Peace” award, with which he will be honored at the UN Climate Summit in New York on Sept. 23. Honored to accept at this key moment for #Climate2014.	0
Scientist: Now about climate change People: Shut up egghead Congressman: god will take care of climate change. God: bitch I sent you scientists. Global warming isn't real Leo. Climate change? Horseshit.	2
Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. With the Earth Institute study pointing to carbon dioxide emissions as the main issue in the warming trend, resulting in extremely hot summers and higher average temperatures, the scientists’ suggestions of the rapid reduction of CO2 emissions and “international cooperation in generating more affordable carbon-free energies” could prove to be beneficial solutions. The measure of introducing a carbon tax should be adopted soon. Many companies and countries are already working to eliminate carbon in their systems, and the ideas of carbon taxes and caps are supported worldwide. While the effectiveness of these efforts remains to be seen, many nations are already aware of the potential dangers related to climate change and have agreed to address the problem.	0
REP. HENRY WAXMAN: In the same document, Mr. Cooney deleted the phrase, “Climate change has global consequences for human health and the environment.” Is there anything scientifically questionable about this phrase? DR. DREW SHINDELL: Again, no. Satellite data disputes global warming. Is this scientifically valid? DR. DREW SHINDELL: No.	2
On Oct. 10, in collaboration with our U.K. friends running the 10:10 campaign, we’re going to run a global-scale Work Party. There will be people everywhere putting up solar panels, insulating houses, etc., all with a 350 theme. We’re going to solve global warming. It’s to say, symbolically, “if we can do this kind of work, then our leaders can do their work. If we can lay out a bike path, then our senators sure as hell should be able to lay out a legislative path.	0
"Related: Scientist who urged government to sue climate skeptics gets millions from taxpayers Climate change, according to Freeman, “is not a scientific mystery but a human mystery. How does it happen that a whole generation of scientific experts is blind to obvious facts?"" Pollution caused by fossil fuels has been conflated with climate change. “Coal is very unpleasant stuff, and there are problems with coal quite apart from climate,” he said. “Pollution is quite separate to the climate problem: one can be solved, and the other cannot, and the public doesn&apos;t understand that.” During his interview with The Register Dyson noted shortcomings in climate models."	2
Corals in other parts of Southeast Asia, Australia, South America and the Caribbean also suffered severe damage from warming in 2010, in what scientists are calling one of the worst global coral bleaching events ever recorded. Global temperature data sets show that 2010 was one of the two warmest years in the historical record. Climate change and ocean acidification, caused when carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans, pose a far more serious threat and could ultimately lead to the total collapse of many reefs. How are climate change, scarcer resources, population growth and other challenges reshaping society? From science to business to politics to living, our reporters track the high-stakes pursuit of a greener globe in a dialogue with experts and readers.	0
Cox has been a lead author on the UN’s past climate estimates. He says that expected warming is in the sweet spot for where action makes sense. Climate sensitivity is high enough to demand action, but not so high that it is too late to avoid dangerous global climate change. CLIMATE CHANGE BRINGS NEEDED RAIN TO AFRICA Some skeptics say that the new analysis relies on too many assumptions to be confident about its results. “I think the method needs more work before the results are convincing,” climate scientist Judith Curry, the former chair of climate science at the Georgia Institute of Technology, told Fox News.	0
"Oklahoma University meteorology professor Jason Furtado said in an email that the report, which he wasn't part of, illustrates the combined power of nature and humans on Earth's climate: ""It was like injecting an already amped-up climate system with a dose of (natural) steroids."" About 450 scientists from around the world helped write the report and in it NOAA highlighted one of the lesser-known measurements, ocean heat content. About 93 percent of the heat energy trapped by greenhouse gases — such as carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas — goes directly into the ocean. And ocean heat content hit record levels both near the surface and deep. NOAA oceanographer Gregory C. Johnson, a study co-author, said the oceans are storing more heat energy because of man-made climate change with an extra El Nino spike."	1
Modern observations reveal that these processes are already underway, including cooling of the Southern Ocean surface. We conclude that a 2°C limit on global warming is not a safe “guardrail.” But that’s not why it made headlines, including in the Washington Post and on CBS Evening News earlier this week. Continued high emissions will make multi-meter sea level rise practically unavoidable and likely to occur this century. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.	0
These and other events are typically called natural disasters. But overwhelming scientific consensus says they are actually the result of human-induced climate change and irresponsible construction in flood-prone areas. Global warming is causing sea levels to rise, while increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events. At the same time, the rapid urbanization of coastal areas is putting more people and property in harm’s way. Given this new normal, it is time to rethink our approach to floods.	0
“Until now, there is no widely agreed upon and measurable definition of human mobility linked to environmental change,” the report says. The estimates vary from year to year. Over 24 million people around the world fled their homes (some temporarily) because of extreme events like floods and drought and other environmental disasters, according to the report. In 2010, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimated that more than 42 million people “were forced to flee due to disasters triggered by sudden-onset natural hazards,” the United Nations report said. In 2009, 17 million people were displaced by such disasters, it said, and in 2008, 36 million.	0
In this chamber, 63 CERN scientists from 17 European and American institutes have done what global warming doomsayers said could never be done — demonstrate that cosmic rays promote the formation of molecules that in Earth’s atmosphere can grow and seed clouds, the cloudier and thus cooler it will be. Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth. Cosmic rays and the sun play an integral role in global warming. Mr. Kirkby…convinced the CERN bureaucracy of the theory’s importance and developed a plan to create a cloud chamber — he called it CLOUD, for “Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets.” Alas, Solomon notes, Kirkby repeated, …the same tactical error that the Danes [the two Danish Space Research Institute scientists who put forth the theory in 1996] had — not realizing how politicized the global warming issue was, he candidly shared his views with the scientific community. “The theory will probably be able to account for somewhere between a half and the whole of the increase in the Earth’s temperature that we have seen in the last century,” Mr. Kirkby told the scientific press in 1998, explaining that global warming may be part of a natural cycle in the Earth’s temperature.	1
Climate-change skeptics will most likely find fault with this research, as they have with similar efforts in the past. For starters, Mr. Anderegg’s dissertation advisers are Christopher Field and Stephen H. Schneider, two of the most prominent advocates of the mainstream view of climate change; Dr. Schneider is a co-author of the new paper. Global-warming science is an echo chamber in which, they contend, it is hard to get published if one does not accept the conventional wisdom that humans are heating up the planet. So they argue that it is circular reasoning to claim a broad scientific consensus based on publication track records. The mainstream researchers reject that charge, contending that global warming skeptics do not get published for the simple reason that their work is weak.	2
ET It’s so brutally cold in the Midwest right now, with subzero temperatures lingering for days, that schools and businesses are closing, mail carriers aren’t delivering mail, transit workers are lighting fires to keep trains running, and people are dying. The “polar vortex” is blasting cold air normally found around the North Pole into the middle of the country. Global warming is to blame. Although this climate link is still under debate, what’s indisputable is that over the coming years and decades, climate change will harm much of the inland United States. Sea levels and hurricanes may get most of the attention, but a warming planet will have impacts throughout the country, from the South to the Great Plains to the Midwest, causing fires, flooding, heat waves, beetle outbreaks, changes to snowmelt, and crop failures that could result in billions of dollars in losses by 2100.	0
AMY GOODMAN: What do you think is the answer here? JOHN HOLDREN: Well, I think the answer, first of all, is for the world to agree, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which goes forward and has negotiations every year and will embrace in 2009 in Copenhagen a new set of rules for the whole world. We have a global agreement on how we are going to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, going forward, and an agreement that will include the tropical forest, that will include ways to transfer some of the revenues from carbon taxes or carbon emission permits in the north to pay for reduced deforestation in the south. We need a variety of measures in this global agreement, going forward, which will get everybody on the same page and which will lead to the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases starting to decline in absolute terms no later than 2020. That’s the sort of trajectory we have to be on, instead of increasing.	1
"One of the challenges is that a dire forecast alone, even when coupled with careful scientific explanations, can sometimes spark feelings of fear, resentment, or helplessness rather than concerted action. But this time, even as the report prompted social-media reactions of “we’re doomed” or “we’re cooked,” other shifts may give a nudge toward hope and engagement. The reduction of fossil-fuel emissions look more feasible. And, from droughts and wildfires to storms and floods, the “lived experience” of many people in the past few years is making action look more necessary. The scenario outlined by the IPCC is ""sobering"" says Mindy Lubber of Boston-based Ceres, a nonprofit that encourages and tracks corporate actions on sustainability."	1
And that’s what the American people need and deserve. So it will be reviewed with the highest standard in mind, and that review is ongoing right now. Rich countries should bear a greater burden than developing ones in reducing emissions and helping countries cope with global warming. Liu Zhenmin, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation, told reporters Friday the issue is “at the core of our concern for the Paris agreement.” He said he wants different rules for different countries “clearly stipulated” in a deal that may be finalized Saturday. The U.S. and European countries want to move away from this “differentiation” among economies, and want big emerging countries like China and India to pitch in more in a final climate deal.	0
The hidden health and environmental costs of using fossil fuels are far greater than previously thought. In a report released Monday, IMF economists estimated that global energy subsidies this year could cost more than $5 trillion, about $10 million a minute — greater than the combined health spending of governments worldwide in 2013. The IMF’s findings represent the latest in a growing chorus of prominent voices calling for reform in fossil fuel subsidies as part of a broader debate about the costs of energy.	0
The United Nations, ever eager to embrace global warming, has a new climate report to be released that claims scientists are more certain than ever that global warming is real, but now there is hard evidence that global surface temperatures have stabilized over the last 15 years according to the U.K.’s weather-watching Met Office. In June, David Whitehouse of the Global Warming Policy Foundation wrote, “The absence of any significant change in the global annual average temperature over the past 16 years has become one of the most discussed topics in climate science. Of course, climate change advocates are trying their best to offer an explanation for the lack of global warming. As Reuters environment correspondent Alister Doyle cited from the report: Scientists believe causes could include: greater-than-expected quantities of ash from volcanoes, which dims sunlight; a decline in heat from the sun during a current 11-year solar cycle; more heat being absorbed by the deep oceans; or the possibility that the climate may be less sensitive than expected to a build-up of carbon dioxide. The draft hedges its bets, stating that it has “medium confidence: that the global warming halt is due “in roughly equal measure” to the aforementioned factors.	2
The company has sunk $6 billion into its arctic ambitions, and experienced several high-profile setbacks, including the abandonment of its drilling campaign in the Beaufort Sea after its oil rig ran aground in 2012. (Related: Oil Price Collapse Triggers Currency Crisis In Emerging Markets) For many opponents, the environmental cost is simply too high. There is no safe way to develop the Arctic region’s oil and gas potential. U.S. Democratic presidential hopefuls agree. Hillary Clinton, Martin O’Malley and independent Bernie Sanders have all opposed drilling in the Arctic.	1
“Given our pervasive dependence on these companies for the energy to heat and light our buildings, to fuel our transportation, and to run our computers and appliances, it is hard for me to reconcile that reliance with a refusal to countenance any relationship with these companies through our investments,” she said. But proponents, who applaud the senate’s vote, say there is no hypocrisy. It is not hypocritical to use fossil fuels in order to try to get ourselves off of fossil fuels, particularly since this is simply unavoidable. Economists say that divestment will not noticeably hurt oil company stocks because, when a university sells its fossil-fuel stock and the price falls, independent traders see that the stock has become undervalued and snap it up. But supporters say their goal is simply to send a message.	1
Antarctica is overall accumulating ice. Still, areas of the continent, like the Antarctic Peninsula photographed above, have increased their mass loss in the last decades. (NASA's Operation IceBridge) Snow that began piling up 10,000 years ago in Antarctica is adding enough ice to offset the increased losses due to thinning glaciers, according to a NASA study.	2
And if all currently available fossil fuel resources were released, the model shows the Antarctic Ice Sheet melting entirely. It is unclear whether this mega-meltdown would be reversible, and on what timescales, the authors note. Unrestrained carbon emissions could cause extreme sea level rise over the next one thousand years. By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion. Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where humans are already shaping climate and the web of life.	0
Variety also reports that Hollywood celebrities such as Jon Favreau, Ava DuVernay, Bette Midler, Michael Moore, Molly McNearney, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chelsea Handler and Al Gore are incensed by the Trump administration’s policy and would welcome the bipartisan hand-holding by Schwarzenegger and Garcetti. But what plays well with the morally-superior Hollywood rich and famous, and liberal elitist career politicians, does not seem to play as well with the rest of reality-minded Americans, who must worry about being able to pay their bills each month. Only 6 percent of Americans are willing to pay $1,000 or more annually in higher taxes and utility costs to subsidize the cost of adding more sustainable energy to fight global warming. 26 percent are willing to pay $300 a year, or $25 per month; another 24 percent are only willing to pay $100 a year, or $8.33 per month; 41 percent of Americans are not willing to pay anything more, or $0.00 per month; and 3 percent gave no answer. The Hollywood forum’s supposed demonstration of bipartisanship conveniently never highlighted the additional costs Californians already pay to subsidize sustainable energy.	1
The findings, by scientists at the University of Colorado Boulder and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found that reductions could be as much as 78 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 while keeping cost in check and meeting expected demand increases. Related: UN climate chief: Deal to reduce emissions within reach The study could be used by the Obama Administration to counter concerns about the cost of its Clean Power Plan, which requires states to cut their carbon emissions mostly from coal-fired power plants 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. A transition to a reliable, low-carbon, electrical generation and transmission system can be accomplished with commercially available technology and within 15 years. While the costs of wind and solar have become increasingly competitive, they remain dogged by fears that they cannot consistently supply power. A high-resolution map based on NOAA solar irradiance data shows a snapshot of solar energy potential across the United States.	1
California’s effort to regulate vehicle emissions could become template for other states if they survive challenges legal challenges posed by the Trump administration. Not everyone is happy that California is so aggressive in pursuing its own climate agenda. Brown’s carbon-neutral pledge could hurt the state’s economy. “It’s overregulation, and I’m concerned that as time goes by, we’ll fall behind because other states aren’t doing the same thing,” says Ms. Separas, who tends to vote Republican. At the same time, she says, “people who don’t live here don’t understand what California has to deal with in terms of its population, how fast we’re growing, the number of cars on the road.	2
And more immediately, early warning systems can buy communities valuable seconds to brace for incoming seismic ripples. One attempt to provide a long-term forecast came last month when a pair of seismologists suggested a possible earthquake forecast at the Geological Society of America annual meeting. 2018 and the following four years could bring an increase of earthquakes over magnitude 7 globally. This forecast isn’t meant to scare anyone, says Rebecca Bendick, a geoscientist at the University of Montana in Missoula and one of the researchers behind the latest forecast. “We actually would like to empower communities to be safer and more responsive to their context, not to terrify people for these years.” The tectonic plates that make up the Earth’s crust are constantly shifting atop the planet’s liquid mantle.	0
The report, the first evaluation of how climate change will affect the greater Yellowstone ecosystem, is a joint project of the Rocky Mountain Climate Organization, a nonprofit that advocates for carbon emission reductions by drawing attention to the likely consequences of climate change, and the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a conservation organization concerned with the park and the land around it. The authors used two warming scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, one based on a medium-to-high-range level of carbon emissions in the future and another one based on a lower set of carbon emissions. Already Yellowstone, which sits at a relatively high average elevation of 8,000 feet above sea level in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, is warming faster than the rest of the globe. The temperature there over the last decade was 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average temperature in the region for the 20th century, the report said. The planet as a whole was 1 degree warmer in the last decade than the average for the 20th century.	0
"Using five economic models, the study shows that the aforementioned extreme events ""may cause substantial decreases in barley yields worldwide,"" with average yield losses ranging between 3 and 17 percent, depending upon how severe the conditions get. ""One of the greatest challenges as a scientist doing research on climate change and food is to illustrate it in a way that people can understand,"" U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist Lewis Ziska told the Associated Press in an email. Few people would complain if global warming ruined Brussels sprouts. In various parts of the world, the decreases could be starker than others, such as an estimated 32 percent decline in Argentina. China could also see a drop in consumption and Davis ""joked"" the U.S. could see a decline in areas such as keg stands and beer pong tournaments, as six packs could rise the equivalent of an extra $20 in Ireland and other countries."	1
“What we’re interested in is a global justice climate framework,” she adds. “We live in a country that is historically one of the largest contributors to climate change so, since the Industrial Revolution, we’ve had certain countries benefit from emissions whereas other countries have not benefited. The countries that are paying the price for industrialization are actually in the Global South, and especially South Asia. At Brown and Green, a loose network that includes teachers and engineers, members have not only marched and rallied but also joined local activists across the bay in Richmond, California, in fighting to reduce pollution from the large Chevron refinery there. “We see often that the so-called villains of the large scale, often oil companies, are operating both at the local level and at the global level,” Ghosh says.	1
"As the EU submitted a plan as a 28-member bloc in Paris, Brexit requires a ""recalibration"" of the agreement, as Christiana Figueres, the chief of the United Nations climate secretariat, cautioned before the vote. That recalibration could effectively weaken the European Union's commitment and focus on addressing climate change, Guy Edwards, co-director of the Climate and Development Lab at Brown University in Providence, R.I., wrote in an opinion piece published by The Boston Globe. Achieving global prosperity especially for the most vulnerable and poorest depends in large measure on whether the Paris Agreement succeeds or not. ""Brexit would make realizing that goal significantly tougher."" Mr. Edwards wrote that Brexit threatens the international cooperation which is essential in fighting climate change."	1
Judith Curry This is an intriguing and wide-sweeping paper that has put together a multi-disciplinary team to examine the possibility of near term catastrophic sea level rise…. Human contribution so far to sea level rise does not seem particularly significant, given the early 20th century rate of sea level rise is about the same as the current rate. Our ways of inferring future rates of sea level rise from ice sheet melting is crude . The danger posed by sea level rise is a function of the rate of change far more than the actual sea level itself. Does Hansen et al.	0
"""The Congress in that regard, particularly the Republican-led House is a lagging indicator there,"" he said. ""I do see change across the political spectrum, and of course the public is solidly on board wit the idea that climate change is happening, it's happening now and that it's caused by human activity."" Action on climate change now is the only way to protect the economy from suffering under the affects of changing temperatures, rising sea levels, and shifting weather patterns. ""Delaying policy actions by a decade increases total mitigation costs by approximately 40 percent, and failing to take any action would risk substantial economic damage,"" reads a White House summary of the Council of Economic Advisers study. ""These findings emphasize the need for policy action today."""	0
"""But there are three reasons for revising that view. One is this paper, finding that we have more room than we thought. Global emissions have stabilised, particularly in China. And the third is a renewables revolution – China now has more than 100 gigawatts of solar cells. You won't find that number in official data, because more than a quarter of it has happened in the last six months."	2
“We are not recovering all the energy we have from a hydrocarbon,” Uribe-Romo acknowledges, “because we just have an intermediate chemical species,” with fewer bonds than sugars, gasoline, and other types of fuels. “We're doing research in order to achieve higher states of carbon using these materials,” he continues, and make the process work across the visible spectrum. This new technology will provide more options for an energy-hungry, carbon-emitting world.

For instance, mass reindeer deaths due to weather events in the last decade has affected livelihood of traditional Arctic herders. “One of the study’s most important findings is that not only are regime shifts occurring, but there is a real risk that one regime shift could trigger others, or simultaneous regime shifts could have unexpected effects,” said Johan L. Kuylenstierna, executive director of the Stockholm Environment Institute. Human-induced climate change from outside the Arctic such as burning of fossil fuels is a key factor. From Canada to Iceland, some Arctic communities reliant on traditional whaling and reindeer herding have already adapted to the new normal, the report shows, moving away from their role as nomadic hunters. In Cape Dorset, Nunavut, Canada, for instance, they became internationally recognized artists, while those in Husavik, Iceland, began organizing whale-watching tours.	0
It is shocking to realize that they’ve gone up 80 p.p.m. over the course of my lifetime,” said Penn State climatologist Michael Mann. We would need to keep the carbon concentration between 405 and 450 p.p.m. to limit warming to the internationally set target of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). But while that concentration rose by less than one part per million annually in the 1960s, the current annual increase of 3 p.p.m.	1
Economists say the most efficient way to cut emissions is through marketplace incentives, like a tax on emissions or making the price of electricity vary with undulations in supply and demand. Such price signals, unlike specific government mandates, allow markets to determine which solutions are the cheapest path to less carbon. You can reach any carbon goal using market-based policies. But “it would require the political will of maintaining higher prices on carbon than we currently have.” This issue is a live one. New York is considering a new carbon tax.	1
As I pointed out in the article, human vulnerability to hurricanes is increasing for other reasons, including sea-level rise that is believed to be a result of greenhouse warming. The folks at Climate Central have come up with an interesting analysis on this. In New York City, about 65,000 more people are in a danger zone than would have been the case if sea level had not risen over the last century. Finally, my article mentioned rising ocean temperatures as a likely factor in feeding more-intense hurricanes. The government and various academic laboratories publish a slew of maps of sea-surface temperatures, but Dr. Emanuel pointed me toward his favorite way of visualizing them: a map series from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.	0
Global warming, by increasing precipitation and melting Arctic ice, could eventually destabilize the Gulf Stream, the ocean conveyor belt that carries tropical waters into the North Atlantic and warms Western Europe. The paradoxical result would be a cooling trend for the region, even as the rest of the globe continued to heat up. Now, a new study suggests that the circulation of warm water in the Atlantic may be tougher to disrupt than previously thought.	0

It means irrefutable, incontestable, and indisputable. Sort of like the early church’s dogmatic belief that the earth was the center of our solar system, a belief Galileo challenged to his demise. The global warming community is like a religion. Now I know why. Okay, the wedgies.	1
Common sense suggests it to be the height of folly to place any faith whatsoever in the predictions of even the very best of today’s most up-to-date climate models in a future atmospheric-CO2-enriched world. Another common sense reason for rejecting the President’s alarmist (and model-based) vision of Earth’s climatic future is that they are unsupported by numerous observations. The rate of sea level rise is not accelerating and may even be decelerating. What is more, multiple studies reveal the stability of small-island States, many of which are not losing, but actually gaining, ground despite continued sea level rise. The President is also wrong on his projection of floods.	2
"Facing criticism over the decision, environment minister Greg Hunt said it was the job of the CEFC to invest in new technologies, so wind and solar didn't count. But Amanda McKenzie says this way of thinking would cripple renewable energy in Australia. It is urgent to move away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy, including large scale wind and household solar. We can't wait for emerging technology to come online, we need to back the technology that is ready to go now,"" she said, adding that one million jobs were created in renewable energy around the world last year. ""Several countries including Australia and Canada appear to have withdrawn entirely from constructive international engagement on climate,"" the report said."	0
"The legislation is currently under consideration in Arizona, Colorado and Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, HB 1674 demands that both the ""scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories"" are taught.

In Colorado, HB 13-1089 calls the bills the ""Academic Freedom Acts."" The bill notes that teaching global warming ""can cause controversy."""	1
Dealing with global warming has become normal, and that’s a good thing. Gone is the “seal the deal” language, aiming for some grand top-down accord, in the months before the failed Copenhagen talks in 2009. I was heartened when President Obama centered his speech on this explanation of what’s being pursued between now and Dec. 12 (the conference technically ends on the 11th but I’ll bet anyone an expensive drink that it carries into Saturday, as it always does): …an enduring framework for human progress, not a stop-gap solution, but a long-term strategy that gives the world confidence in a low-carbon future.	1
“However, this kind of behavior is typical of ice shelves all across Antarctica.” But what happens next could offer clues about possible climate change fingerprints. “My guess is that it will simply grow back — the Larsen C is not close to the instability that we saw in the ice shelves to the north before they disintegrated,” Scambos said, referring to the melting and fracturing of two neighboring ice shelfs to the north, called Larsen A and Larsen B. Global warming is triggering bigger structural changes to this corner of Antarctica. Scientists will also be also be watching how fast different parts of the glacier are flowing and whether new features appear, such as water pooling on the surface of the glacier due to melting, that may point to climate change, according to Christopher Shuman, a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. “It is not inconceivable this is a sign of changes to come.	0
But the report also factored in global threats from climate and rising ocean acidity caused by carbon dioxide pollution, for the first time. The threat to reefs from warming seas is hardly hypothetical: in 2010, one of the warmest years on record, spiking water temperatures damaged coral on a global scale rarely witnessed before. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide, is absolutely necessary if we want any hope of preventing a lot of the dire situations that are presented in the report. Still, local human impacts like overfishing and pollution remain the most pressing threat for reefs, the report noted. And while 25 percent of reefs are now within “marine protected areas,” less than a quarter of these protected zones were rated as “effectively managed.” If unchecked, growing global and local pressures will place more than 90 percent of reefs at risk by 2030, the report found.	0
"The IPCC report included suggestions for individual changes to help cap global temperature rise to the aspirational limit of 1.5ºC set by the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, such as eating less meat, flying less, and avoiding travel in cars. ""Climate change and environmental concerns are definitely a strong motivator for people eating more plant-based food … for the health of the planet there are compelling reasons to reimagine the food we use to fuel our bodies,"" said Chalk. Cutting out meat from an individual's diet reduces their greenhouse gas emissions by 35%, and substituting carbon-intensive meats such as beef and lamb with chicken or pork can reduce one person's emissions contribution by 18. A study published in October last year, led by Oxford University, observed the global impact of food consumption on the environment with data from every country and suggested that the average person must eat 75% less beef and 90% less pork to prevent the global rise in temperature above 2ºC this century. Marco Springmann, who led the study, proposed a food tax to reflect the emissions cost of production, which would result in a 40% increase in the price of beef and a 20% increase in the price of other meats."	1

He promised to revive the industry. His stance helped him to turn coal-involved Pennsylvania into a swing state (and win it), and it helped bolster a wider blue-collar appeal that proved central to his election victory. Coal jobs are going to be hard to revive, even by a president-elect who voiced concern about carbon emissions or climate change. “These three nominees certainly represent a Trump administration that is going to pursue an ‘all of the above’ energy policy, and it's going to be particularly favorable toward the oil and gas industry,” predicts Varun Sivaram, an energy security expert in Washington at the Council on Foreign Relations. By contrast, he says “cheap natural gas is putting coal out of business.” To the degree that Trump’s team successfully promotes natural gas, it could even hasten coal’s decline, or at least offset any forward impulse for coal that the new administration can provide.	1
"[See Photos of Greenland&apos;s Melting Glaciers] If the Jakobshavn glacier had melted completely, ""it contains enough ice to raise global sea level by half a meter — just this one glacier in Greenland,"" Rignot said. If all the land ice on the planet were to melt, it would raise sea levels about 197 feet, he added. Some of the melting that has already occurred is likely irreversible, and could take hundreds of years to reverse. American impact While global sea levels have risen about 2.75 inches over the past 22 years, the west coast of the United States has not seen much of a rise in ocean levels. That&apos;s largely because of a long-time-scale weather pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is masking the global effect."	0
4) Arctic sea ice will disappear by 2015. “Peter Wadhams, who heads the Polar Ocean Physics Group at the University of Cambridge… believes that the Arctic is likely to become ice-free before 2020 and possibly as early as 2015,” Yale Environment 360 reported in 2012. Arctic sea ice has increased since then. At its lowest point during 2014, sea ice covered about 1.7 million square miles -- an area nearly half the size of the United States. Wadhams did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday morning.	1
"And climate disruptions to water and agriculture have been increasing."" Behind the changes to the climate is human activity, Holdren said. These phenomena are consistent with the ongoing changes in global climate, which we know with very high confidence are being caused mainly by the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses released by human activities. The video is part of an extended push by the White House this week to put climate change on the American agenda despite reticence from Republicans on Capitol Hill. In addition to the report — which launched on a slick government website called GlobalChange.gov — top Obama adviser John Podesta is hosting an event at the White House focusing on how climate change is impacting specific regions of the United States."	0
Over the years, the city has contended with back-to-back storms and flooding events. None have been as severe as the current situation, but many have taken a human toll. More people die here than anywhere else from floods. “More property per capita is lost here. And the problem’s getting worse.” Residents along the Gulf and Southeast coasts contend with flooding on a regular basis.	1
His colleague Jack Kaye, associate director of NASA’s Earth Science Division added “NASA science provides an important knowledge base that the centres and their surrounding communities can use in preparing for changing climate conditions.” Yet Anthony Watts, writing on his blog site Watts Up With That, points out that “one of the biggest space disasters ever, the Challenger disaster, was caused by FREEZING COLD WEATHER and idiotic management that ignored risks related to cold weather as warned by engineers.” “I have a pretty hard time believing that about a degree of warming is going to cause all these woes. That and the fact that NASA has had a nearly 9 year hurricane free window in Florida to not worry about launches.” Despite repeated assertions that man-made climate change is negatively impacting human populations (“Global warming is happening now … our planet is warming and natural systems are struggling to keep up,” intones the National Wildlife Federation), satellite evidence actually shows that there has been no increase in global temperature for 18 years. The sea is not rising. Furthermore, “It hasn’t risen in 50 years.” Mörner calls the predictions of catastrophic sea level rise “the greatest lie ever told”. Whereas those predictions are all based on computer models, which can be easily manipulated to give any answer desired, Mörner’s findings are based on “going into the field to observe what is actually happening in the real world”.	2
"Specifically, the researchers suggest that some forms of Rubisco adapted to the presence of the oxygen it indirectly helped to generate. These forms of Rubisco developed in order to not mistake oxygen for carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are about the same size and have similar chemical characteristics. ""When Rubisco takes in oxygen instead of carbon dioxide, it is not possible to make biomass because there is no carbon in oxygen."" Ultimately, the researchers want to create microbes that possess ancestral versions of Rubisco."	1
“People are far too quick to yell fraud at the other side. I think such language is both selfish and counterproductive.” (It should be noted that neither Mr. McIntyre nor Dr. McKitrick nor Mr. Fuller are climate scientists, and that many in the climate science community vehemently reject their critiques of Dr. Mann’s work as flawed and biased. Global temperatures are warmer now than at any time in at least the last 1,000 years. Other climate contrarians like John Christy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama well known for his minority view that carbon dioxide emissions pose little threat to the climate, warn that Mr. Cuccinelli’s effort to subpoena research documents in the midst of a heated scientific debate could open the door to a dangerous politicization of science. “Do all of us who work as university employees (not federal employees) become subject to being investigated by anyone with a grudge?” Dr. Christy wrote in an e-mail message.	1
Global carbon emissions in 2017 are expected to be around 2% higher than last year, hitting a new, unwanted record high. The news is a blow to hopes that emissions had peaked, and to efforts to keep global warming below 1.5°C, as agreed in the Paris climate accords. After three years of little to no growth in total global carbon emissions, 2017 will see a relatively major spike. The precise figure is unknown, partly because the year is not yet complete and partly because there is uncertainty in the statistics, but emissions are expected to be between 1% and 3% higher than 2016, with a best estimate of 3%. The research is published simultaneously in the journals Environmental Research Letters and Nature Climate Change and was announced at the United Nations Climate Change conference, known as COP23, in Bonn.	1
California, by contrast, is on course to phase out its remaining nuclear capacity, based on concerns about safety and maintenance costs. But that means that California, like New York, still relies heavily on fossil fuels: natural gas for electricity, plus of course gasoline in transportation. Human emissions are behind observed warming in the Earth’s surface temperatures and oceans, and that action to reduce greenhouse emissions is an urgent global priority. California and New York are arguably America’s leaders on this front, as large states that have set ambitious goals. Yet even they are feeling their way on a journey where it’s a lot easier to get to a 50 percent reduction in emissions than to achieve the more complete “decarbonization” of economies that scientists see as the real target.	0
Sea levels and hurricanes may get most of the attention, but a warming planet will have impacts throughout the country, from the South to the Great Plains to the Midwest, causing fires, flooding, heat waves, beetle outbreaks, changes to snowmelt, and crop failures that could result in billions of dollars in losses by 2100. “Too many people see climate change as a coastal issue,” said Julie Cerqueira, executive director of the US Climate Alliance, a governor-led group responding to the climate crisis. The impacts of sea level rise are so clear and so targeted. “It is much harder to pinpoint one driver of impacts in the Midwest because you’ve got so many things interacting.” The impacts range from the shifting ranges of plants and animals to longer pollen seasons and even a cross-country ski race canceled due to lack of snow. But one of the most important and noticeable effects in the Midwest is an increase in rain, especially heavy rain, scientists say.	0
"ET An iceberg floats in Disko Bay, near Ilulissat, Greenland, on July 24, 2015. Steve Nerem, a geophysicist at NASA and the University of Colorado, Boulder, said the world is all but certain to see a three foot sea level rise due to the concentration of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. Even if global emissions stopped immediately, the effects of CO2 already in the atmosphere would lead to rising sea levels, in a sort of ""inertia"" effect. The ocean rise could hit three feet by 2100 or later, Nerem said. ""Eventually we're going to get to 3 feet,"" he added."	1
The three lawmakers have all expressed skepticism about the reality of human-caused global warming, yet in their brief they say that the political system, not the courts, should deal with the problem. The three just last week circulated draft legislation that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing any regulations on greenhouse gases beyond those already written for vehicles. The science is uncertain and the costs of reining in carbon dioxide and other emissions will be too high. Yet in their brief they say there is no need for judicial intervention because Congress and the administration are already dealing aggressively with the matter. In this, they take the same position as the Obama administration, which has also argued that the appeals court decision should be overturned because the administration is hard at work on the problem and does not need the courts’ help.	2
"The film also targets the State Department's environmental analysis, which was carried out by a third-party contractor linked to the oil industry. The contractor claimed that building the pipeline will not affect the climate, which the film points out was based on the assumption that Canada's tar sands will be tapped regardless. Tapping the one of the largest pools of carbon on the planet ""will be game over for the climate"" due to the elevated concentration of carbon dioxide in the tar sands. ""If we were to fully exploit this new oil source, and continue to burn our conventional oil, gas and coal supplies, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eventually would reach levels higher than in the Pliocene era, more than 2.5 million years ago, when sea level was at least 50 feet higher than it is now,"" Hansen wrote in a New York Times op-ed. The film also explores the consequences of tar sands spills, which are much more difficult to clean up than conventional oil."	0
Here's another reason the glass might be half full after the Paris summit: the involvement of the business sector. One attendee called the presence of big business at the meetings “amazing,” noting that not just Asian and European but American big business attended in force, including representatives from Dupont, Monsanto, and Kellogg. The Paris summit would help trigger a shift away from fossil fuels and encourage greater investments in renewable energy. The Stowe Global Coal Index, which tracks the stock performance of twenty-six major producers, has lost 59 percent of its value this year. And the agreement is said to be a powerful signal to global markets to shift away from fossil fuels and toward a clean energy economy.	1
"by Stephen C. Webster September 18, 2013 7:14 PM New research co-authored by leading U.S. climate scientist James Hansen, a longtime employee of NASA who recently resigned to engage in climate activism, paints a grim picture of a future Earth left virtually uninhabitable by current warming trends. The paper, published Monday, concludes that energy-related decisions being made by today's government leaders will ultimately ""determine the fate of humanity."" Earth's climate-regulating systems may be more sensitive to higher levels of carbon than scientists previously suspected. They also calculated the atmospheric changes that would be produced by burning off the estimated stock of Earth's fossil fuel reserves, finding that it would result in a planetary apocalypse. ""Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize adaptation to climate change,"" they write."	0
The fossil fuel industry is only a good investment if you bet on the destruction of our collective planet — and that’s not the kind of future we want Stanford invested in.” In an effort to embarrass the number-one rated university in America, the student coalition threatened that for the first time in the school’s 130 year-old history, the 2016 graduating class intends to show its rejection of the university’s governance by refusing to give a “Senior Gift,” and as alumni to withhold all future donations until Stanford divests in what the students refer to as “climate chaos and environmental injustice.” With the third-largest university endowment on the planet with about $22 billion in assets, Stanford’s divestment rejection follows similar actions by the $300 billion California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and the $7 billion University of California endowment. Stanford’s Board of Trustees chastised the divestment movement by adding that fossil fuels have not only helped lift millions around the world out of poverty by providing cheap and easy access to energy, but energy companies have also been widely recognized for the critical role they play in reducing the U.S. carbon footprint through innovation, production and research. A credible case can be made for divesting from the fossil fuel industry. The university emphasized that they are committed to environmental initiatives that have a tangible effect on climate change and the university’s carbon footprint, such as Stanford’s high-tech greenhouse gas-reducing energy system, off-campus solar plant and a cutting edge climate research center that addresses a range of environmental and sustainability challenges. The divestmentfacts.com, which opposes politically biased investment decisions, suggested that Stanford may have been influenced by a recent “study by CalTech professor Bradford Cornell that demonstrated that “divestment comes at a high cost for university endowments and has negligible influence on fossil fuel companies’ actual behavior.”	1
A companion video report by the Frontline television team tells the story in the voices of former company scientists. The probe by this team takes the timeline on Exxon’s focus on climate change several years earlier than a previous investigation of oil industry assessments of global warming by the Union of Concerned Scientists. In the first place, there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels. It was July 1977 when Exxon’s leaders received this blunt assessment, well before most of the world had heard of the looming climate crisis. A year later, Black, a top technical expert in Exxon’s Research & Engineering division, took an updated version of his presentation to a broader audience.	1
Pulling out of such a flexible agreement would be like “poking everyone in the eye with a stick,” he added. Still, the fact that the US isn’t going to meet its current pledge will make a big difference to what the Paris deal can achieve. The rise in global temperatures should be kept within 2 degrees Celsius of the pre-industrial average by 2100. Even with the Obama administration’s pledge, the planet was poised to warm by 3.3 degrees C, according to Climate Interactive, a nonprofit that calculates the effects of climate policies, working closely with scientists at MIT. The Trump administration’s policies are poised to warm the planet by a further 0.3 degrees C, Drew Jones, co-director of Climate Interactive, told BuzzFeed News.	1
Yes, you read that right. One of the two regions of the world most closely identified with frozen water could have almost none of that left for a good portion of the year by 2012. A warning sign that some scientists worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping point. “One even speculated that summer sea ice would be gone in five years.” Never one to let facts get in the way of its agenda, the Bush Administration is relentlessly battling the “reality-based” community in Bali. And it is busy organizing a parallel conference in Hawaii in January that’ll have as its target “aspirational, nonbinding” goals for emissions reductions.	0
Along with Washington, businesses are trying to turn the whole Durban process away from urgent emissions cuts and toward an increasingly perplexing and sophisticated array of non-solutions. These include large-scale biofuel plantations, genetically engineered “supercrops,” synthetic biology, unworkable yet lucrative carbon offset schemes and something called geoengineering, whereby scientists would turn the globe into a giant experiment by injecting newfangled materials into the atmosphere to try to counteract global warming. Global warming can be tackled without changing entrenched patterns of production and consumption in industrialized societies. Even worse, they assume that the multifaceted ecological and societal crises that we face today can be addressed without confrontation, sacrifice or trade-offs. They assume that the free market can solve the climate change crisis when, in fact, it created the crisis.	2
In the meantime, learn more from David Biello at Scientific American and Rob Jackson at Stanford University on Science Friday.

“What right do we have to do things that, even if they don’t affect us, are going to be someone else’s problem a thousand years from now?” asked Ian Joughin, an ice sheet expert at the University of Washington who was not involved in the new research. “Is it fair to do that so we can go on burning fuel as fast as we can?” Caldeira told me recently that he considered this study his most important work and hopes it will help convince world leaders and the public of the scope of what’s being sacrificed for the sake of cheap fossil energy now. ’s poorer nations have few affordable choices other than fossil fuels. See my recent look at India’s argument for expanded coal use.) Here are a few snippets from our chat, but I encourage you to listen to the full exchange (and post other excerpts you find noteworthy): Ken Caldeira on our bias to the immediate: Last night, at dinner I ate more than I should have, maximizing my pleasure at the expense of my long-term wellbeing.	1
In May, Obama gave Shell permission to drill six exploratory oil wells off Alaska's northern shore, drawing complaints from Greenpeace and other environmental groups. A titanium capsule with the Russian flag planted on the Arctic Ocean seabed under the North Pole. Concerns about Arctic oil leading to increased global warming are overblown because the stuff will be so expensive to drill. David Victor, an international relations expert at the University of California, San Diego, told BuzzFeed News that the real Arctic environmental worries are oil spills and similar disasters. Technically, control of Arctic territory — which is under ice much of the year — is governed by a treaty called the U.N. Convention of the Law and of the Sea.	2

"We’ll wait and see but hopefully that’s going in the right direction"" Professor Terry Hughes, from the James Cook University's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, told BuzzFeed News the budget held ""no substantive cuts, but no real response to climate change"". Hughes has previously warned that the coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef have become the ""new normal"". An appropriate response to the bleaching would have been to invest heavily and speed up the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, and that didn't happen. ""The Budget was an opportunity to respond in a meaningful way to the back-to back bleaching of the coral reef, and that wasn't taken."" Hughes said ""the elephant in the room is climate change"" when it comes to saving the Great Barrier Reef, with many interim measures ""gimmicks and bandaids""."	1
"Today's Global Climate Strike is an offshoot of the #FridaysForFuture movement that has already seen teenagers in a host of countries go on strike. The movement began with 16-year-old environment activist Greta Thunberg, who in August last year started skipping school on Fridays to protest outside Sweden's parliament. Human-made climate change is a real and urgent threat, one that's already playing out in the form of rising seas and warming temperatures. According to Thunberg's latest update, strikes and marches are planned in 105 countries today, including what is expected to be the first large-scale events in the US. ""Tomorrow we schoolstrike for our future."	0
That process is a key mechanism in how hurricanes build and sustain themselves over the ocean, but typically, these storms lose momentum as they release rains over land. The situation in Houston, however, is far from typical. The flood area is so far and wide that it is acting like part of an ocean, feeding warm moisture up into Harvey. Adding to this rare confluence of meteorological circumstances is Houston’s unique layout. Unchecked development and lack of zoning requirements have left the city especially vulnerable to flooding, according to a joint investigation by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune published last year.	1
It is hard to keep track of the outrageous and destructive behavior of Donald Trump. However, the greatest long-term threat caused by his administration is that not only is it failing to take action to stop climate change, but it is actually taking steps to make the problem worse. The Trump Administration rejects science, ignores the reality of climate change, and pursues policies that are directly leading to more carbon emissions and a major exacerbation of the crisis. On behalf of its friends in the fossil fuel industry, the administration is doing exactly the opposite of what must be done. In 2017, federal scientists announced that the string of the four warmest years on record across the globe continued.	0
And yet, a few days — well, within a few days of my arriving, I saw the newspapers were full of this sort of sniping at this great man and wondered about it and thought it’s not — it doesn’t do the skeptics any great justice, and I think it’s just disturbing that someone who has done so much for the world could be treated in that way. But in any case, one of the people who was having a bit of a shot at Al Gore was a man called Dr. William Gray, and he spoke at the University of North Carolina within just a couple of days of me speaking. The human impact on the atmosphere is just too small to have a major effect on global temperatures. And those sort of assertions really need to be tackled and explained, because so many people just accept that from a professor as a given and accept it as a credible sort of statement. So, tonight, I’d really like to just have you reflect upon that statement a little bit as I talk and try to explain to you the way the atmosphere works, the nature of this problem, and what is actually happening to our world right now.	2
The fossil fuel industry may be emitting twice as much methane as previously thought. After carbon dioxide, methane is considered the second biggest source of manmade greenhouse gases. The study’s authors have pulled together the most comprehensive methane emissions database yet, and concluded that emissions from fossil fuels are between 60 and 110 percent greater than current estimates.	1

"Dr. Trusel, a professor of Geology at Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email that meltwater rivers are similar to rivers you might expect to find anywhere else on the planet – they simply exist on top of ice sheets instead of land, transporting melted ice and snow, rather than rainwater, from one location to another. ""We've known that the margins around Antarctica experience surface melting today – in some places like the Antarctic Peninsula this melt has been quite intense,"" he adds. Following intense melt episodes, the ice melt can pond in crevasses and form lakes that destabilize ice shelves in a process. This has resulted in several large-scale and catastrophic ice shelf collapses in recent decades."" The recent survey found that the meltwater network in the Antarctic was extensive, consisting of drainage pools, rivers, waterfalls, and other features."	1
Mr. Swaminathan is considered the architect of India’s “Green Revolution” for his work in the 1960s developing high-yield grain varieties that ended decades of severe famine. India continues to suffer from high inflation in food prices and widespread chronic hunger. Such problems will be vastly worse if global temperatures continue to rise. “For every one degree Celsius rise in mean temperature, the wheat loss is estimated to be of the order of six million tons per year,” he said, according to The Hindu newspaper. India’s total wheat production was about 75 million metric tons in 2009.	0
ET WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is pushing back on skeptics who say the polar vortex proves climate change is a hoax. In a new video to be posted on the official White House website Wednesday, President Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, warns against buying into the idea that a cold snap disproves that the earth is getting warmer overall. If you've been hearing that extreme cold spells, like the one we're having in the United States now, disproves global warming, don't believe it. The two-minute clip puts the Obama administration at odds with conservatives and Republicans who have said the bitterly cold week in much of the United States proves their point that climate change isn't real. The video is just one part of the administration's pushback on that idea.	0
But this letter didn’t come from a think tank or an environmental group. Instead, the signatories of the June 1, 2015 dispatch were chief executives of some of the world’s most carbon-intensive companies – oil supermajors like BP, Eni, and Statoil – companies that profit enormously from the very fuels carbon pricing aims to curtail. Pricing carbon obviously adds a cost to our production and our products. Others noted that only European firms signed on, representing just one slice of a sprawling international oil and gas industry. But if taken in earnest, the letter from six oil supermajors reflects a widening acceptance of climate change as a challenge humanity should – and can – tackle.	1
“The risk of climate change is clear, and the risk warrants action,” the company’s website reads today. “Increasing carbon emissions in the atmosphere are having a warming effect.” Given the turn the Republican Party took away from acknowledging global warming nearly a decade ago, when Newt Gingrich said “our country must take action to address climate change,” Tillerson was one of the only Trump nominees to publicly maintain that climate change was, in his words, an “important global issue.” When asked during his confirmation hearing if he, now retired from the company, will “still personally stand by” Exxon’s position, Tillerson said “I do not take exception to that statement,” before adding “I might articulate it a little different as to my personal views.” Indeed, Tillerson did give a different articulation in one of his written responses, saying increasing carbon emissions were not “key” to understanding the rise in global temperatures. I agree with the consensus view that combustion of fossil fuels is a leading cause for increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “I understand these gases to be a factor in rising temperature, but I do not believe the scientific consensus supports their characterization as the ‘key’ factor.” In reality, the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that synthesized thousands of climate studies to examine the physics behind a warming atmosphere concluded that increased carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning coal, oil, and natural gas, caused the “largest contribution” to global warming, followed by other greenhouse gases that are likewise emitted by human industry. Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said that while his comments at the hearing and in writing were not “logically inconsistent” — one can believe carbon dioxide contributes to warming but isn’t the driving cause — the two testimonies have left different impressions.	0
It’s a story that runs counter to popular perception, which holds that religious people do not believe in climate change – or believe that it falls outside the realm of human control. In truth, people of faith have played important roles in environmental causes for generations. Devout Americans are generally less likely to be concerned about global warming than their nonreligious peers. But among Catholics this may be starting to change. In the year since Pope Francis released his encyclical, Laudato Si, imploring his followers and fellow believers to care for the earth and its creatures, observers say more and more Roman Catholics are beginning to view climate change as a moral issue in which caring for the earth and caring for the poor intersect.	1

Various updates | Over the weekend, in a “Memo to America” and lots of details released to the press, President Obama set the stage for today’s release of the Environmental Protection Agency’s final “Clean Power Plan,” aimed at meeting the administration’s pledges to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Obama spoke today about the new climate plan. The United States is committed to cutting its carbon footprint. This is vital if there’s to be a chance of turning the current 83-page outline of a new worldwide climate agreement into something acceptable to the world’s variegated nations at Paris climate talks in December. (There will be an agreement, as always; the question, as always, will be whether it will result in a meaningful shift in heat-trapping emissions and, for poor countries, financial assistance.)	1
Researcher Aslak Grinsted and his coauthors used a model based on worldwide temperatures to describe past hurricane activity and predict it in future. Their model shows hurricane frequency rising dramatically as the planet warms over the coming decades. Hurricane surges are more likely caused by global warming.

A press release listed recipients like the National Audubon Society “for their work to preserve local Whooping Crane habitats,” as well as the University of Texas Marine Science Institute in order to help in Hurricane Harvey recovery. “During this very active year for our Wildlife Rescue and Recovery program, this gift comes at a particularly important time for us,” said Tom Schmid, president and chief executive officer of the Texas State Aquarium, a $40,000 beneficiary. The planet’s remaining fossil fuels must be kept in the ground. But the boom in plastics production relies on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of oil or natural gas from deep in the earth. The Obama Administration encouraged fracking in the state’s vast Permian Basin and many other shale fields as a way to achieve U.S. energy independence.	1
"We can argue about whether it's good for national security,” say Lorne Stockman of OCI. “We can debate those things and we can have different beliefs about economics and free-trade and those kind of issues."" Do we really want to open up billions of barrels of high-carbon fuel in Alberta, and put in the infrastructure that will be here for 50 years to access that resource, and let it out into the global market.

The conference organisers received too few quality abstracts to be able to put on a full program. Professor Bala at first assumed that this was a uniquely Indian problem, until he read an article in Nature which questioned why there was a shortage of upcoming climate scientists worldwide. I was surprised to learn that shortage of good climate scientists is a global problem. Indeed, Nature was reporting on a group of climate scientists at the Laboratory of Dynamic Meteorology in Paris who had recently published summaries of some of the field’s foremost challenges as a way of driving up interest in the subject. Sandrine Bony, a member of the team, said that there was a misconception that the major questions in the field of physical climate change are settled; something that Bony said was “absolutely not true,” adding “In fact, essential physical aspects of climate change are poorly understood.” Just 49 PhD’s were awarded in atmospheric chemistry and climatology in the United States in 2013, according to the American Institute of Physics in College Park, Maryland.	1
The fact that some errors crept into the IPCC’s most recent report (issued in 2007) is embarrassing. And Pachauri should have been more careful about drumming up business for his organization. That global warming constitutes a fraud is a hoot. As Pachauri told me when I interviewed him in December 2008: “Thousands of people are part of what some of these people say is a conspiracy? My God!	0
Humans are exacerbating global climate change. The question is, what? On Thursday evening, May 7, 2009, Mr. Kay offered his students “Extra Credit” for accompanying him to a presentation at the Santa Monica Public Library given by Adina Abeles, Planning Director of the Center of Ocean Solutions.	0
“It’s important to recognize that in the US, air pollution has been going down. But that doesn’t mean the problem is solved,” says Tracey Holloway, an atmospheric scientist at the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. On a global basis, Professor Holloway notes, 1 in 8 deaths each year are caused by air pollution. Like Nolen, Holloway thinks it’s time to start decoupling the discussion of pollution from that of climate change. “Something coming out of a tailpipe or a smokestack is a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide or sulfur dioxide,” she says.	1
Albert told the Guardian: “I understand why these more dramatic titles are used and it does help bring attention to the issue that I firmly believe will become a major issue for the islands in the second half of this century from climate change.” Which, actually, rather undermines what he told the Guardian earlier and you wonder why he felt it was necessary to say it, other than to spare the Guardian its blushes, because the point he is making here is a political and emotional one, not a scientific one. Even so, we should be thankful for small mercies. Not often a scientist is prepared to call bull on the way the left-wing press routinely hypes up global warming scares. Albert has done the world of science a favour.	2
The reason for this difference is unclear, he said, but it could be attributable to factors like variations of sea-surface temperature patterns, modeling flaws or changes in aerosols or land use. “Certainly global warming has contributed to the rate at which the ground has dried out because of the warm temperatures,” Dr. Nielsen-Gammon said. The magnitude of the dryness is well beyond what global warming would be able to do so far. To ignore the notion of climate change would be irresponsible, Mr. Perry said, but he added, “To say it’s 100 percent of that is irresponsible as well.” In his view, reducing carbon dioxide emissions seems like the right thing to do for the long term, taking into account future generations. “Does it hurt us to reduce CO2 emissions?” he said.	2

“The smartest thing to do at this point,” she says, is to “be building resilience to the risks we face. And in many cases, those risks are being exacerbated by a changing climate.” While detailed studies and analyses about the role climate change may have played in Harvey's severity will take time to complete, most scientists say they are confident about at least a few factors. Among the clearest: Sea surface temperatures are higher. In addition, warmer subsurface water in the oceans means that storms can last longer than they might otherwise, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo. Research he and others have done leads him to expect that climate change may actually lead to fewer hurricanes, but ones that are more intense and longer-lasting. Relatively few storms, and the huge variability among storms makes, the observational record tricky.	1
“There’s more research saying it's going to be extremely inefficient and costly to run a grid solely on variable energy like the sun and the wind – even if you allow for heroic progress on energy storage,” says Danny Cullenward, an energy economist who serves on an independent advisory commission on California’s climate policies. And when the price tag rises for action on climate change, he adds, “those costs will eventually be seen and will affect the politics.” That doesn’t mean support for greening the energy system is about to crumble in states like California and New York. Global warming is caused mostly by human carbon emissions. “I’m optimistic ... we’ll find affordable ways to get this done,” Dr. Cullenward says of the energy transition. But “it's not a small undertaking.” States are providing some trial-and-error lessons along the path.	0
In the highest-profile fight, voters in Washington state decided not to charge companies for pollution that contributes to global warming. Ballot initiative 1631, which proposed charging companies for their carbon pollution, failed after earning roughly 43% of the early voting count, too big a deficit to overcome with absentee ballots. We must address global warming by weaning our state off of fossil fuels. Economists have long proposed a carbon tax as a solution to the climate crisis. The Washington state measure would have initially charged large climate polluters $15 per metric ton of carbon they released into the atmosphere.	0
Conservation of fresh water is important because it is a limited resource: Less than 1 percent of all the water on Earth can by used by humans. With growing populations and changing climates, fresh water is becoming increasingly valuable, says Edward Osann, a senior policy analyst and water efficiency project director at the National Resources Defense Council. We are seeing more extremes: more substantial droughts, followed by substantial floods. “If we can sustain ourselves while using less fresh water, we will be more resilient while going into these fluctuations in the hydrologic cycle of the future.” The US population grew by 4 percent between 2010 and 2015, or 12 million people, but total withdrawals for public supply – water that comes out of kitchen faucets and lawn sprinklers – decreased by 7 percent. According to the USGS, total public-supply withdrawals were at their lowest levels since 1995.	0
"Playland Miniature Golf course in Guerneville enveloped in floodwaters before dawn from the rising Russian River. Malina Pettibone, a Guerneville native, dances with an American flag while listening to Nelly Furtado as the Russian River waters rise. Because of a warming climate, we could see more of these wetter atmospheric events that drench the ground, sparking floods and mudslides. ""When you have a series of these atmospheric events like we have had this year, the soil can't absorb anymore water and whatever continues to fall gets dumped right into rivers, lakes, and streams,"" said Paul Ullrich, a climate scientist at the University of California at Davis. ""What we are anticipating, in light of climate change, is warmer temperatures that bring more moisture to the air and thus lead to wetter AR events."""	0
The world's biosphere is now adding to global warming, turning traditional assumptions about greenhouse gases on their heads, according to a new study published Thursday in the scientific journal Nature. Plants absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, as part of photosynthesis. But a team of researchers looking closer at this assumption have found that human-induced changes to plants and animal populations have transformed the biosphere's status from a net greenhouse gas sink to a net greenhouse gas source. “Typically we think of land as a net ‘sink’ of carbon dioxide,” said Dr. Anna Michalak, a professor at Stanford University and co-author of the study, in a press release.	1
Although polar vortex visits to the US aren’t new, they’ve become more frequent in recent decades. A theory gaining traction among climate scientists is that melting sea ice is disturbing the normal Arctic air flow pattern. So, ironically you might have some really cold days in the Midwest despite global warming. Forecast minimum temperatures for the 12 hours from 7 p.m ET Jan. 30. A new analysis by the Washington, DC–based nonprofit the Brookings Institution found that of the 15 states hardest hit by climate change — including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Arizona, and other inland states — 14 had voted for President Trump, who does not believe in human-made climate change.	1
In August, BBC Radio 4 invited Lord Lawson – the former chancellor of the exchequer, now the chair of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank that rejects mainstream climate science – on to the Today programme. Global temperatures had not risen in the past decade. This went unchallenged by the interviewer, and the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, has now launched an investigation into Lawson's appearance. Some of the BBC's most prominent science presenters, including Brian Cox and Jim Al-Khalili, were appalled.	1
He speaks normally in very conservative and measured language. So, to hear that kind of talk is very, very troubling. Just to give you one last quick example, scientists have documented already the deep oceans are warming, the glaciers are melting. We’re seeing violent weather increase. We’re seeing a change in the timing of the seasons.	0
“Momentum is clearly building,” says Todd Stern, US special envoy for climate change, in an email to the Monitor. “We still have a lot of ground to cover between now and a successful Paris agreement. More clarity is needed on what the targets really mean for global warming. Still, many say they are optimistic that the talks in Bonn will prepare them for a strong outcome in Paris. In the lead up to Paris, there is widespread consensus that something needs to be done to curb global warming.	1
"But China will have to address serious obstacles if 2014 is to remain its peak year. Energy use is expected to grow as urbanization climbs from 55 percent to its 2020 goal of 60 percent, and the country will have to decisively turn toward other non-coal sources of power. Carbon emissions did not peak in 2014 and are set to rise until 2030. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

The actual studies (glacier sizes, global temperature, ecosystems) have all yielded radically different conclusions based on their readings.

Formerly known as the Gilbert Islands, Kiribati consists of 33 small Pacific islands dispersed over 1.4 million square miles of ocean. It is one the world’s lowest lying nations, leading to fears it will be swamped by rising sea levels in climate change doomsayers are proved right. Sea levels have not risen by as much as previously predicted. Oceanographer William P de Lange and marine geologist Bob Carter said there was little evidence to support claims, such as those by Al Gore, that the sea would rise by 20 feet by the end of the century. “No justification exists for continuing to base sea-level policy and coastal management regulation upon the outcomes of deterministic or semi-empirical sea-level modelling, they wrote.	2
estimates that it may be responsible for up to one-third of human-induced climate change. Among the sources adding methane to the atmosphere are leaking gas pipelines, coal mines, cattle and sheep, and animal wastes. Methane can be much easier and less expensive to contain than carbon dioxide emissions. Since 2004, the United States has been part of something known as the Methane to Markets Partnership, a 38-country agreement to reduce methane emissions worldwide through cost-effective technologies. Now the United States and Mexico are trying to get all those countries to sign on to an expanded agreement called the Global Methane Initiative.	1
Muddy salt marshes get a bum rap. Coastlines around the world hold enormous ecological value, both as habitats for species that can live nowhere else and as a buffer for surging seas during storm events. And, like the rainforests and reefs, salt marsh ecosystems are in trouble. A recent study of eight salt marshes conducted by the US Geological Survey found that erosion in the marshes had led to a net decline in sediment in all of the biomes studied.	1
Holthaus called the essay “a master class in modern climate denial” and then proceeded to attempt a “fact-check.” This provided a useful indicator of the types of statements that now constitute “climate denial” and the mindset that produces catastrophism. There are a total of 18 tweets in his thread, which I’d encourage everyone to read in full. Climate change may or may not bear responsibility for the flood on last night. Fact: Climate change is producing heavier rainfalls worldwide.” One need not be a master logician to see that climate change can produce heavier rains without bearing responsibility for all floods. Next up, the essay observes that climate catastrophism produces “a level of obsession with reducing carbon footprints that is otherwise reserved for reducing waistlines.” That’s a good line, if I do say so myself.	1
When I ask how climate change comes up in his work, Pezold says he doesn’t engage in that conversation much locally, unless it’s to secure climate-specific funding. Otherwise, there isn’t much benefit to bringing up a heavily politicized point of debate. Bringing up climate change derails discussions of community-based solutions for problems like flooding and the resulting problems of transportation and public health. Retired Lieutenant General Russel Honoré, who is often credited for turning around Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, has for the last twelve years been organizing around environmental issues in small communities of color in his home state. “I don’t talk about climate change with people in Louisiana,” he tells me.	2
But later research indicated that HFCs are potent greenhouse gases, contributing significantly to climate change. International officials have reconvened in hopes of amending the Montreal Protocol to include HFC limits. A global reduction in HFCs could prevent 0.5 degrees Celsius in warming over the next century. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s a moderate step in suppressing climate change. Before the Paris climate agreement, Earth was on track to warm 4.5 degrees Celsius by 2100.	1
It is just one more example of fake news by advocates pretending to be experts and reporters. We’ve already won the battle over public opinion. Fewer than half of Americans believe human activity is responsible for most global warming. Voters rank “stopping global warming” dead last when asked to rank problems they want government to address. Some 42 percent of voters say they aren’t willing to spend even $1 a month to stop global warming.	1
"Friday's report was written and reviewed by some 900 scientists who looked at more than 9,000 studies on climate change. But the panel's latest report will likely face extra scrutiny after the previous one included an error that exaggerated the rate of melting glaciers in the Himalayas. As a result of our past, present, and expected future emissions of carbon dioxide, we are committed to climate change and effects will persist for many centuries even if emissions of carbon dioxide stop. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon echoed the sentiment. ""We need to build resilience and seize the opportunities of a low-carbon future,"" he said."	0
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will vote today on a bill promoting carbon trading, which sets greenhouse gas emissions limits and allowances for each industry and then creates a system to trade the allowances. Carbon trading actually delays the crucial process of big polluters reducing their emissions. We host a debate between Annie Petsonk of Environmental Defense and Daphne Wysham of the Institute for Policy Studies. [includes rush transcript] AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to carbon trading.	1
The environmentalists have stepped up their game in the population debate, too. A group called Californians for Population Stabilization claims “population growth [is] wildly out of control” and is causing “further degradation of America’s natural treasures.” A 2008 report from the Australian government says that babies are hurting the nation’s economy. A study recently that concludes children are detrimental to the environment because they contribute to global warming. The study suggests that couples should have at least one less child than they were planning on having. Last notes in his book: In the London Independent, columnist Johann Hari worries that, “It will be easier for 6 billion people to cope on a heaving, boiling planet than for 9 or 10 billion.”[x] In Hot, Flat, and Crowded, Tom Friedman argues that overpopulation is one of the drivers of a coming global catastrophe and talks about the “steady population growth” the world will experience in the future as if he’d never seen a fertility chart.	1
Their brief lists several actions, from the Clean Air Act in 1963 through recent energy legislation, that show that the political branches of government are acting on the problem of emissions. They say that the government is spending billions of dollars a year in climate change research and mitigation efforts. The United States ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and participates actively in global climate diplomacy. They even note that in 2009 the House passed a sweeping cap and trade bill to control greenhouse gas emissions – legislation that all three of them vigorously opposed. “No one can seriously question that the executive branch, acting through the E.P.A., the Department of State and various other departments and agencies, has aggressively employed its various statutory authorities in acting on climate change,” they write in their brief.	1
But now it sits on one side off the island. The rest of the land is simply gone, claimed by the sea. The global sea level rise is caused by two main factors: water expanding as it warms, and large-scale melting of glaciers and polar ice caps. Modeling from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that it would rise at an accelerated rate this century. Timeon can measure the sea level by other means.	1
“But bycatch far outstrips the threat of whaling at this time, and we need a global response to the issue.” The IWC has made considerable strides in whale conservation when it comes to the effects of climate change and ocean noise. It has even enacted a few measures to prevent bycatch, most of them species-specific. But a global threat warrants a global response. It’s still unclear what that response might look like, but internal scientific expertise may position the IWC to lead it. “We don’t have all the pieces together yet because the conversation hasn’t really started at that global level,” says Henry.	0
The extra snowfall that began 10,000 years ago has been slowly accumulating on the ice sheet and compacting into solid ice over millennia, thickening the ice in East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica by an average of 0.7 inches per year. This small thickening, sustained over thousands of years and spread over the vast expanse of these sectors of Antarctica, corresponds to a very large gain of ice – enough to outweigh the losses from fast-flowing glaciers in other parts of the continent and reduce global sea level rise. Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away. “But this is also bad news. If the 0.27 millimeters per year of sea level rise attributed to Antarctica in the IPCC report is not really coming from Antarctica, there must be some other contribution to sea level rise that is not accounted for.” The study has caused quite a stir in the community of scientists who work in Antarctica, with some questioning the reliability of the satellite data and saying it does little to change the narrative that the continent is losing mass.	1
"Still, Trusel says he is all but certain that melting in the Antarctic will become more widespread in the coming years. ""My research has assessed how surface melting may change in the future under various climate scenarios,"" he adds. Human emissions of greenhouse gasses essentially control the future of surface melting in Antarctica. The more we emit, the more surface melting and the greater potential for future ice shelf collapses and accelerated contributions to sea level."" The effects of warming global temperatures are already being felt in the Antarctic, says Stephen Price, a meltwater researcher at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico."	0
If so, it will be a monumental step forward. Climate change is perhaps the most significant challenge of our age. Climate change is a global catastrophe that’s unfolding before our very eyes in slow motion. Its most probable consequences include agricultural failures, mass migrations, social unrest, economic collapse, and political instability. Such phenomena will be devastating for many reasons.	0
Cruz has even taken the position of supporting a flat tax rate, something hardly surprising, since he thinks IRS agents are better utilized as a supplement to the Border Patrol. And his stance on climate change is growing more extreme by the day. Global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers. There’s barely an issue where his position is anything other than to shame and berate those who believe in rational, reasoned action. The country is catching on to that fact.	2
"""It may be that a tipping point will be reached soon and that the world might start to warm rapidly but so far reality has stubbornly refused to conform to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s computer modelling."" Even if climate change was happening, Abbott said, he argued it could be a benefit. Then there’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. He blamed ministers in his own government for not being able to go as far as he would have liked in reducing the renewable energy target when he was prime minister, and he blamed the Turnbull government not campaigning on energy prices for costing the party seats at the 2016 election. ""After a net gain of 25 seats at the previous two elections, when we had campaigned on power prices, we had a net loss of 14 when we didn’t,"" he said."	2
"""The earth is alive and it changes and it moves,"" Daniel Turner told PJ Media on Friday. ""It’s just a little bit presumptuous that mankind can change it and controls it.""

"“All across the planet, the historical increase in the atmosphere’s CO2 concentration has stimulated vegetative productivity,” reads a portion of the 1,063-page report, called “Climate Change Reconsidered II: Biological Impacts.” “This observed stimulation, or greening of the Earth, has occurred in spite of many real and imagined assaults on Earth’s vegetation, including fires, disease, pest outbreaks, deforestation and climatic change.” The Heartland Institute says more than 30 scientists served as authors and reviewers for the new report, which it claims cites more than 1,000 peer-reviewed studies supporting the belief that climate change is not detrimental to the biosphere. The Heartland Institute describes itself as a think tank promoting public policy ""based on individual liberty, limited government and free markets."" Human impact on the global climate is small. The findings are a stark contrast to the messages from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which in a report released last week concluded that in many regions of the earth, changing precipitation and melting snow are altering hydrological systems, which negatively impact the quantity of water resources. The IPCC’s report also states that climate change is forcing terrestrial, freshwater and marine species to shift their geographical ranges and migration patterns."	2
He said that Dr. Soon’s grants were not typical for his staff and that it was a “concern” but nonetheless acceptable, because the money came with no conditions and the grant sources were disclosed when Dr. Soon’s work was published. “As long as there are no strings with the money and as long as there is full disclosure, I am fine with it,” Dr. Alcock said. Global warming is under way. Greenpeace used a Freedom of Information Act Request to obtain extensive records and e-mails from the Smithsonian regarding Dr. Soon’s research funding. It discovered, for example, a $55,000 grant from ExxonMobil in 2007-8 for research on “Arctic climate change.” For more than a decade now, climate scientists and their allies have linked Exxon money to groups that promote skepticism of the science underlying global warming.	0
"""When we ... increase the average temperature, we also alter what happens to the extreme, so higher average temperatures mean vastly more frequent extreme heat events occurring. It's really those extremes that are the problem."" Even if we manage to keep the rise in global temperatures to 2C, major climatic events such as heatwaves will continue to have unprecedented effects on our environment. Harris notes that our current conservation and management techniques may not be enough to battle these changes.

would “use its rule-making power to do so.” Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Cuccinelli, a Republican, called the E.P.A.’s finding “an incredibly far-reaching decision” arising from what he called uncertain data and a “flawed process.” “The potential impact of the finding on Virginia agriculture, the energy industry, manufacturing jobs, and in truth the cost of living for every single Virginian,” Mr. Cuccinelli said, “would create a staggering burden.” Mr. Cuccinelli also added that the E.P.A. should consider new information, including recently publicized e-mail messages from a British climate research institute. The e-mail messages showed scientists using faulty data to support the notion of manmade global warming. He also referenced the work of the International Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body charged with assessing climate research, which has come under criticism from climate change skeptics for what they say has been sloppy science and, in some instances, conflicts of interest among panel members. Most climate scientists and environmental groups — while acknowledging that some of these charges deserve investigation — say the fundamental determination that human beings are contributing to a warming climate is sound.	2
"WATER UNDER PRESSURE Demand for water is expected to increase by 2050 as the world's population is forecast to grow by one-third to more than 9 billion, according to the United Nations. This in turn will lead to a 70 percent increase in demand for food, putting more pressure on water through farming, which is already the biggest consumer of water. As climate change contributes to rising sea levels and extreme weather, at least one in four people will live in a country with chronic or recurring shortages of fresh water by 2050.

One recent study calculated that over the 50-year period ending in 2001, the direct monetary benefits conferred by the atmospheric CO2 enrichment of the Industrial Revolution on global crop production amounted to a staggering $3.2 trillion. And projecting this positive externality forward in time reveals that, rather than leading to “fields that no longer grow,” it will likely bestow an additional $9.8 trillion in crop production benefits between now and 2050. All that our world leaders need is a little more common sense, in order to avoid the nonsense of seeking a globally-binding treaty to reduce CO2 emissions. Indeed, it is high time for them, and for all of us, to recognize and embrace the truth. Contrary to misguided assertions, political correctness, and government edicts, carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.	2
One project involved pushing the most sacred temple of the Sikh faith, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India, to go organic. Nearly 100,000 people eat at the temple daily, Singh says, and “that food now is being grown organically.” Moreover, “we need to realize that we, the people of the United States and other developed countries, are contributing significantly in warming the planet. So it is our moral responsibility to really do the maximum to mitigate the effects of carbon emissions. At Bangladesh Environment Network, or BEN, this is a struggle that spans decades. BEN was founded in 1998, though at that time it wasn’t focused on climate change but rather on stemming local pollution, says BEN’s global coordinator, Saleh Tanveer, a mathematics professor at Ohio State University.	0
It makes a suitable soundtrack while you read Justin Gillis’s news article on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s latest monthly global climate update, with the core finding being that 2015 is almost a shoe-in to be the hottest year since regular record-keeping began in 1880. Here’s the opening section: Global temperatures are running far above last year’s record-setting level, all but guaranteeing that 2015 will be the hottest year in the historical record — and undermining political claims that global warming had somehow stopped. Last month had been the hottest September on record, and in fact took the biggest leap above the previous September that any month has displayed since 1880, when tracking began at a global scale. The agency also announced that the January-to-September period had been the hottest such span on the books. The extreme heat and related climate disturbances mean that delegates to a global climate conference scheduled for Paris in early December will almost certainly be convening as weather-related disasters are unfolding around the world, putting them under greater political pressure to reach an ambitious deal to limit future emissions and slow the temperature increase.	1
And it's calving was one of the largest ever on record. The video below shows smaller icebergs that were recently calved from a glacier in Iceland. In California alone, rising sea levels could threaten $100 billion in infrastructure and imperil half a million people. A report prepared in 2009 by Gleick and other researchers further explores the destruction that could accompany rising sea levels. It found that if sea levels rise four and a half feet by 2100, California could lose 41 square miles of land to erosion.	0
This is the shock finding of a study likely to send paroxysms of terror through the alarmist “science” establishment as it finally realises the game is up and that the evidence just doesn’t support its fantastical scare story. The study was conducted by Paul Homewood for the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Global warming has made next to no difference to Britain’s climate. His conclusion: Apart from being slightly warmer, the UK’s climate appears to be little different to the past. The study was prompted by a highly alarmist UK Climate Change Risk Assessment report, published in 2012 by the UK government’s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), warning that ‘climate change’ would lead to more extreme weather events in Britain.	2
Please come back fast, we need you! The tweet prompted a response from government scientists, who explained that winter storms are just more proof that global warming is changing the climate. Global warming isn't happening. https://t.co/LDqfq4JH9n “Snowstorms require two things: moisture and freezing air temperatures,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said. “There are plenty of places where winter temperatures would have to rise by 10, 20, even 30 degrees Fahrenheit before it would stop snowing.	2
A titanium capsule with the Russian flag planted on the Arctic Ocean seabed under the North Pole. Some say that concerns about Arctic oil leading to increased global warming are overblown because the stuff will be so expensive to drill. The real Arctic environmental worries are oil spills and similar disasters. Technically, control of Arctic territory — which is under ice much of the year — is governed by a treaty called the U.N.

As an important analysis in Nature Climate Change put it, “The next few decades offer a brief window of opportunity to minimize large-scale and potentially catastrophicclimate change that will extend longer than the entire history of human civilization thus far.” To put it another way, this year’s election choices may shape coastlines 10,000 years from now. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have both mocked the idea of human-caused climate change, with Trump suggesting that it is a hoax invented by China to harm the American economy (he now says that last point was a joke). Brussels survived this week’s terrorist attacks, but it may not survive climate change (much of the city is less than 100 feet above sea level). Doesn’t it seem prudent to invest in efforts to avert not only shoe bombers but also the drowning of the world’s low-lying countries? “We have a political system that engages quickly and powerfully in response to terrorism and security risks,” notes Daniel Esty, an environment expert at Yale Law School, “but doesn’t seem capable of galvanizing action on climate change and other risks that are less visible and spread over time and space.” The reason seems to be — how do I put this politely?	0
“Risk management is central to continuity of NASA operations, and the agency is including potential climate extremes in its risk management framework,” said Calvin Williams, assistant administrator for NASA’s Office of Strategic Infrastructure. His colleague Jack Kaye, associate director of NASA’s Earth Science Division added “NASA science provides an important knowledge base that the centres and their surrounding communities can use in preparing for changing climate conditions.” Yet Anthony Watts, writing on his blog site Watts Up With That, points out that “one of the biggest space disasters ever, the Challenger disaster, was caused by FREEZING COLD WEATHER and idiotic management that ignored risks related to cold weather as warned by engineers.” “I have a pretty hard time believing that about a degree of warming is going to cause all these woes. There has been no increase in global temperature for 18 years. As for the sea level rises which NASA considers such a pressing threat to its assets, the verdict of Swedish geologist and physicist Nils-Axel Mörner, a former chairman of the INQUA International Commission on Sea Level Change who has studied global sea levels for 35 years is: “the sea is not rising”. Furthermore, “It hasn’t risen in 50 years.” Mörner calls the predictions of catastrophic sea level rise “the greatest lie ever told”.	2
The Guardian reported: Barack Obama and the G20 nations called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies in 2009, but little progress had been made until oil prices fell in 2014. In April, the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, told the Guardian that it was crazy that governments were still driving the use of coal, oil and gas by providing subsidies. We need to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies now. Barack Obama and the G20 nations called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies in 2009, but little progress had been made until oil prices fell in 2014.

The military’s presence in the state adds another dimension to the solar power argument. The Navy, Army, and Air Force have all invested increasingly in solar and other renewables in a bid to make the military more efficient, economical, and resilient. There is a coming transition from fossil fuels to renewables, but are reluctant to speak about it because it’s tied to climate change. The national security argument helps pave the way for “a sensible, well-reasoned conversation about advanced energy,” he says. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.	1
It is evidence that CO2 is not nearly as strong a climate driver as the IPCC has been assuming. But defenders of climate change hysteria were looking for loopholes. It’s important to keep in mind that there are natural short-term variations in global temperature that happen right alongside human-induced warming. For instance, it would have been impossible for the IPCC to predict if a volcanic eruption might temporarily cool the Earth, as the Mount Pinatubo eruption did in 1991. The IPCC left itself the same excuse in the report, stating that “the model projections … do not fully account for natural variability.” Spencer agreed that the idea that humans contribute to global warming, saying, “The IPCC’s claim is that they are 90 percent sure that humans have ‘contributed to’ the observed warming.	1
Similarly, from the NGSS, Disciplinary Core Idea ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems: Things that people do to live comfortably can affect the world around them. But they can make choices that reduce their impacts on the land, water, air, and other living things. Global Warming is a theory and should be taught as such in our schools. We are also very concerned that Evolution will be taught as fact, when in reality, it too, is only a theory.” “The standards should teach facts as facts and theories as theories, allowing students to form their own opinions in a healthy, non-partisan way,” Reeder said. Regarding the science standards’ expectations of students in the core areas of global climate change and human impacts on the earth, Reeder said, “The reader of this naturally comes to the conclusion that humans have poorly managed our natural resources in past history; thus, we now need international treaties and more government regulations to mitigate the problems.” “It also stresses the environmental impacts caused by the use of fossil fuels without talking about the positive impacts they have had and will continue to have, especially in Wyoming,” Reeder told Breitbart News.	2
According to Pershing, the resulting impacts were minor. The bigger problem with the Trump administration's US team at the talks is that “they are disengaged,” he said, and failed to offer political muscle to help move the talks forward when COP24 discussions hit road bumps. The challenge moving forward will be getting countries to more deeply cut their carbon pollution. “I think there’s going to be a reckoning next year,” Samantha Gross, a fellow in the Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate, told BuzzFeed News. Countries not only need to ramp up their climate goals, she said, they need to figure out how to meet the ones they’ve already set.	0
"Sea water, by way of comparison, only reflects a quarter of that. As climate change nudges temperatures slowly upwards, it unleashes a vicious cycle of melting and absorbing, melting and absorbing in the arctic. It's a bit of a chicken-egg thing: we have less ice because it’s warm, but it’s really warm, so we have less ice. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Scientists call this kind of cycle a ""feedback loop,"" and have been sounding the alarm bell for years."	1
Climate deniers can still call global warming a hoax when looking at hotter temperatures, dying forests and increasing wildfires. Millions of burning acres are a little more obvious to most than calving glaciers or seas rising by centimeters. I was a little distracted while creating this cartoon.	0
"Now, we’re on our third one this year. Everyone agrees that ""something is very, very wrong with the Arctic climate,"" as Mashable's science editor tweeted on Wednesday. The meltdown results from the complex interaction of players including emissions-driven climate change, warm air and water, and shrinking ice area. Divvying up blame is tough, but the general trends are clear. Normally, this time of year is winter in the arctic, although you might not know it from this week’s balmy 40-degree temperatures in Svalbard, an island halfway between Norway and the North Pole."	1
AMY GOODMAN: Dr. John Holdren, some scientists believe China has already overtaken the United States when it comes to being the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. Can you talk about what’s happening in China, as you teach there? China passed the United States in 2007 as the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas that is most responsible for the disruption of global climate. Of that carbon dioxide, the human activities emit to the atmosphere — about three-quarters is coming from burning coal and oil and natural gas, about one-quarter is coming from tropical deforestation.	1
"But this approach has caused controversy when it has been applied to more technical, scientific issues – especially climate change. Cox and Al-Khalili, among others, argue that climate scientists are near-unanimous in agreeing that the world is warming, that humans are causing it, and that it is dangerous. Somewhere between 90% and 100% of active climate scientists agree that global warming is real and human-caused. So having someone who disagrees with this consensus position, the argument goes, isn't providing ""balance"" or being ""impartial"" – it's giving a fringe position undue prominence and suggesting that there is a scientific controversy where none exists. This discussion is not new."	0
"GAH! Malcolm Turnbull got a double espresso... and completely dropped it ""You'd have to ask Josh Frydenberg,"" Turnbull said. We will not be imposing a carbon tax and we will not be imposing an emissions trading scheme. Twenty minutes later Frydenberg was asked why he put an emissions intensity scheme on the table on Monday morning. ""[An] emissions intensity scheme was never government policy,"" Frydenberg said again."	1
“It is a skepticism that stands in contrast with prevailing views in Europe and has been linked to the influence of U.S. talk radio, the ‘oil lobby,’ an enduring love affair with cars, and a history founded on limiting the role of government,” reports Reuters. “Science can be controversial in a country where evangelical Christians make up a quarter of the adult population. Global warming is caused due to human activity, and only 44 percent believe it to be a “very serious problem” versus 90 percent of Brazilians, 68 percent of the French and 65 percent of the Japanese population. The result? Widespread opposition even to the inadequate climate change cap and trade bill still stuck in the Senate.	0
Last month, a major new climate commitment came out of the United States: a pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. Is increasingly necessary if the world wants to avoid the most severe repercussions of global warming. And it involved a major economy – the world’s fifth largest – but not the federal government. Instead, it was California Gov.	0
These days, the Trump Administration has maintained close ties with Saudi Arabia, tried to deregulate the industry, and approved new pipeline infrastructure to enable more exports. According to Priscilla Villa, the South Texas organizer for Earthworks, “Plastics shows how issues go beyond silos and intersect.” She says lower-carbon fracked gas was first touted as a “bridge fuel” to help shift reliance from coal-fired power plants to renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Fracking wells leak massive quantities of methane gas, which is eighty-six times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over a twenty-year span. A Texas Commission on Environmental Quality agent responding to complaints became ill after using an infrared camera to document emissions otherwise invisible to the human eye. Below ground, fracking uses a mixture of water and chemicals to drill, and residents worry it could both contaminate and exhaust their already limited drinking supply.	1
They aren’t alone. “This Green New Deal is nothing more than a radical far-left proposal that has no basis in reality,” Sen. James Inhofe, a prominent climate denier who once brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to mock global warming, told BuzzFeed News by email. You can’t run the machine called America without fossil fuels and nuclear energy or the millions of jobs this deal seeks to eliminate. The Green New Deal is being “defined by the most outlandish parts of it,” Gorman said. “It's hard to combat that.” “This was a mistake by Democrats because it took an issue they have been winning on and turned it into a liability,” Conant said.	1
ET Posted on February 13, 2019, at 11:24 a.m. ET The Oroville Dam's overflow channel failed in 2017. Major dams in California are five times more likely to flood this century than the last one due to global warming. That means Californians can expect more disasters like the Oroville Dam, whose overflow channel failed in 2017 after days of flooding had filled state reservoirs to 85% of their capacity, leading to the evacuation of more than 180,000 people and losses of around $300 million. In June, an analysis led by UCLA researchers concluded the Oroville Dam spillway overflow was worsened by climate change.	0
AMY GOODMAN: Very good. Well, talk about what you are seeing as the connections right now? Global warming does not make more hurricanes. And that’s because hurricanes take their energy from the temperature of surface waters. In the case of Katrina, it started as a category one, I think 70 mile-an-hour winds when it glanced off South Florida, but as it moved through the Gulf where surface temperatures are about 80 degrees, it became enormously more powerful.	2
It helps explain why the draft accord stipulates that nations should reevaluate their greenhouse gas limits every 5 years, a provision that environmentalists pushed for during a negotiating session in Bonn in early September. Still, many say that instating monetary incentives, such as a global carbon tax or bottom price for carbon emissions, is the only effective way to ensure that countries reduce their emissions enough to avoid irreversible damage to the environment. A global price on carbon is politically and economically unlikely, but individual nations have already implemented and may continue to implement such systems to meet their climate goals. Despite the uncertainties, officials say that progress is being made behind the scenes as trust develops between the delegations and differing positions begin to solidify. “Momentum is clearly building,” says Todd Stern, US special envoy for climate change, in an email to the Monitor.	1
Still, supporters argue that carbon-taxing schemes can be designed to offset the negative impact they could have on low-income populations. “[E]verything depends upon how it’s structured and where the money goes,” says Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, a nonprofit, consumer-advocacy group. Increased revenue from a carbon tax can be used to alleviate other tax burdens. With some simple financial reshuffling, a carbon tax can be completely revenue neutral and can even spur growth. Politics present another obstacle in the way of implementing a successful carbon tax.	1
”This is a colossal mistake,” said Myron Ebell, director of global warming policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington group that advocates free markets and limited regulation and has attacked the administration recently. ”If they persist, there will be war.” The CO2 balloon bursts (March 14, 2001, by Douglas Jehl with my help) Under strong pressure from conservative Republicans and industry groups, President Bush reversed a campaign pledge today and said his administration would not seek to regulate power plants’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas that many scientists say is a key contributor to global warming…. The White House had received ”a lot of communications” from those critical of any attempt to regulate emissions that are viewed as contributing to global warming. ”Fortunately, the president responded quickly,” Mr. Kelly said. The victory dance (March 16, 2001) The White House action left opponents of controls on carbon dioxide doing the e-mail equivalent of high-fives.	1
“Who his key advisers will be on climate change and what they will tell the president and what the president will act on are all unknowns.” Among Trump’s top officials, Pruitt, his pick to lead the EPA, perhaps offers the clearest record of how his climate change views will translate to action. Pruitt has denied the veracity of climate change, co-authoring an article for the National Review that stated “the debate is far from settled. Global warming is occurring thanks to human activity. “Pruitt, is known as an Oklahoma fossil-fuel advocate and an attorney general who has fought environmental regulations. By all signs, agency budget cuts and a regulatory rollback are coming,” writes The Christian Science Monitor’s Zack Colman, about how Pruitt might try to reshape the EPA.	0
And it’s a little more expensive than traditional burning pulverized coal, but it’s effective. And so, you build one plant at a time, using the most up-to-date technology you need, and then it’s amazing, in another twelve months, before your demand increases for electricity, you build another plant with better technology. China has already overtaken the United States when it comes to being the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. Can you talk about what’s happening in China, as you teach there? JOHN HOLDREN: Well, first of all, it does seem that China passed the United States in 2007 as the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide.	1
Despite Texas Freedom Network president Kathy Miller’s accusations that the oil and gas industry was attempting to hijack the science books, even the Huffington Post reported that the Texas State Board of Education adopted the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt environmental science book. Also, Texas public schools use the popular online learning tool BrainPOP “which isn’t just pro-climate change, it’s pro-man-made climate change,” a Texas teacher, who asked to remain anonymous, told Breitbart Texas. There is a connection between human activity and an assumptive change in global climate. It has been almost a decade since Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth promoted the notion of global warming later rebranded as climate change. Yet, for all the environmental climate literacy foisted onto K-12 classrooms, it continues to be shrouded in factual controversy.	0
A common charge against environmentalists is that they’re hypocrites. They tell us to reduce our carbon emissions. They condemn Big Macs, yet they buy raspberries imported from a different hemisphere. They sneer at our plastic shopping bags, yet every year they buy a new iPhone.	1
When I was flying over Montana in a small plane with the scientist Steven W. Running, I was awed by the devastation we were seeing across one mountainside after another, and kept saying so. At one point, yelling over the engine roar, Dr. Running shut me up with a simple observation: “Look how much is left!” His point was that the situation is not hopeless, and I came to see that he was right. The forests of the world are continuing to take up a large amount of carbon. Even given all the problems we are seeing in the American West and in other affected regions, the healthy forests still outnumber the sick ones. Policies and action are needed to help them stay healthy, scientists say.	1
However, Peterson believes that in light of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report and “given that the world’s coral reefs are in severe crisis, now is the time to fund coral reef science”. The IPCC report was created to outline the difference between a 1.5-degree Celsius and a 2-degree Celsius rise in global surface temperatures. If global temperatures are allowed to rise to 2 degrees Celsius, “virtually all” coral reefs will be lost. Peterson is particularly concerned about funding priorities in light of a federal government decision to give a small nine-person organisation nearly half a billion dollars in funding earlier this year. “This is especially stupid when the Australian Government is giving over $400 million to the inexperienced Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF),” said Peterson.	0
Since the climate denial choir is still largely filled with “Cool Dudes” — as sociologist Riley Dunlap of Oklahoma State University termed old, white, conservative, educated men — then a traditional authority figure calling a different tune on global warming might change their views. Similarly, a Yale and George Mason University partnership has suggested that telling people that “97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening” can help change minds — another argument for the power of authority. The reality of sea level rise forced everyone to come up with a plan, including trusted local business leaders and Republican politicians. Though they differ on the details, the one thing all of these experts agree on is that just telling folks the facts — temperatures are going up, seas are acidifying, and the most likely reason is people burning fossil fuels — doesn’t move the needle on climate opinion. Instead, ears seem to open only when people they trust ask them to take a second look at something they thought disagreeable.	0
"If the 0.27 millimeters per year of sea level rise attributed to Antarctica in the IPCC report is not really coming from Antarctica, there must be some other contribution to sea level rise that is not accounted for.” The study has caused quite a stir in the community of scientists who work in Antarctica, with some questioning the reliability of the satellite data and saying it does little to change the narrative that the continent is losing mass. Others said it demonstrates the challenges of trying to assess the state of ice sheets on such a huge land mass, where time scales and environmental factors often differ marketedly. Snow accumulation has dramatically increased on West Antarctica’s coastal ice sheet in the 20th century. But one of the study&apos;s authors, Elizabeth Thomas, a paleoclimatologist with the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, said many of the same factors leading to increased snowfall also have been found to be responsible for the thinning of the ice shelves. ""In fact, having more snowfall doesn&apos;t necessarily balance the thinning."	1
"by Kathleen Rest February 7, 2007 10:27 PM U.S. behind curve on global warming February 7, 2007 Two recent reports on climate change put the U.S. position on global warming in stark relief. Human activity is the main cause of global warming, while the other investigation reveals widespread political interference in federal climate science here in the United States. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) solidifies the scientific understanding that the increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere are man-made. The report finds that evidence of the climate's warming ""is unequivocal"" based on observed increases in the world's average air and ocean temperatures, the widespread melting of snow and ice and a rising global average sea level."	0
Environmentalists, however, had said the downsized version of the power plant would not sufficiently protect rare species and continued to push for the project’s relocation to more disturbed land. The commission reviewers determined the visual impact of the Ivanpah power plant could not be reduced but recommended that the commission’s board license the project because of “overriding considerations.” “It will provide critical environmental benefits by helping the state reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and these positive attributes must be weighed against the project’s adverse impacts,” Terry O’Brien, a deputy director at the energy commission, wrote in a memorandum filed Wednesday. It is because of these benefits and the concerns regarding the adverse impacts that global warming will have upon the state and our environment, including desert ecosystems. “Staff’s position on the I.S.E.G.S. project should not be read as a blanket endorsement of all solar projects,” Mr. O’Brien wrote.	0
The global population of polar bears, estimated at 26,000, will decline by 30 percent over the next 35 years due to melting Arctic ice. The study, which was published in the Royal Society Biology Letters, was lead by biologist Eric Regehr, whose team determined that there is a 70 percent chance this significant decline will occur by 2050. “Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) depend on sea ice for most aspects of their life history,” the researchers wrote.	0
In this state, mountain glaciers have retreated so far inland that little ice is left to cleave off into the water, he said. Alaska&apos;s glacial ice loss now comes from thinning, not from icebergs calving at the front of the glacier. Most of their potential for catastrophic ice mass loss has already run its course. Operation IceBridge is in its sixth year of monitoring changes in polar ice. The airborne mission fills a gap between two ice-tracking satellites.	1
Dr. Christy and Judith Curry, president of Climate Forecast Applications Network, suggested that the creation of such a team would restore credibility in the way the scientific method is applied to climate change, as hypotheses would be tested and challenged. Christy, in particular, has repeatedly said groups associated with the IPCC suppress findings that contradict mainstream views about the impact of human activity on climate change. Climate change is, beyond a reasonable doubt, the result of humans releasing fossil fuels and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Ninety-seven percent of climatologists, earth scientists, and meteorologists say they believe humans are contributing to climate change, an assertion Politifact has said is “mostly true.” Of the 70,000 peer-reviewed articles on global warming published in 2013 and 2014, only four authors rejected the idea that human activity is the main force driving climate change. Critics of the proposal by Christy and Curry warn that a team tasked with presenting an alternative viewpoint could undermine the credibility not just of the IPCC, but of the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS).	0
Yet the preliminary evidence we’re seeing from the White House suggests that the administration may have taken a very different approach. If the documents we have seen so far are representative, it appears that the White House installed a former oil industry lobbyist as the chief of staff for the Council on Environmental Quality and then systematically sought to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from reporting on dangers to health, the environment and the economy. There may have been an orchestrated effort to mislead the public about the threat of global climate change. These are serious allegations, and they are ones that we’ll be exploring in detail in this hearing and in our ongoing investigation. AMY GOODMAN: Congressmember Henry Waxman questioning NASA climatologist Drew Shindell.	2
As a new Congressman four years ago, Bridenstine claimed that global temperatures had stopped rising: “Global temperature changes, when they exist, correlate with Sun output and ocean cycles,” he said then. But just like those temperatures, which have set heat records in the last three years, Bridenstine’s views have evidently changed. Carbon dioxide is in fact a greenhouse gas. “All that is very real and happening.” The questions irked Republican senators, such as Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who are unwilling to accept the scientific evidence that people are causing climate change. “We can’t have a confirmation hearing without climate change coming up,” complained Inhofe, the author of The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future.	1
The fires by my parents’ place or here in California are nothing compared to what is going on in Alaska. (All you need to do is check out a fire map to get a sense of the scale.

And the BlueGreen Alliance has a track record of success. Its member organizations established a training program to teach manufacturing workers to use less energy and reduce waste, and its Industrial Energy Efficiency initiative has saved manufacturers millions of dollars through energy conservation. A real investment in getting off the fossil fuel addiction is far more likely to produce long-term, high-paying jobs than building the Keystone XL pipeline. But that, ultimately, is beside the point. “There are no jobs on a dead planet,” the saying goes.	1
We’re quite comfortable with it given the realtime benefits of abundant cheap energy. As a kicker, here’s some of what one former employee, Ed Garvey, says in a videotaped interview about the company’s climate research around 1980, and what he sees as a lost opportunity: It saw that this is an opportunity to lead in the science and the discussion. Had Exxon continued in that role, there might not be such a cacophony of anti-climate arguments that are ongoing now because there would have been somebody at the table who came from the side of fossil fuel use and would have been shown to be a leader in terms of the science. That just didn’t happen, but I really think that was their intention when I was working there. Postscript, 11:05 a.m. | Via Facebook, Matt Nisbet of Northeastern University led me to a relevant piece on The Conversation on the merits and drawbacks of “NGO Journalism,” of which this InsideClimate report is an example.	1
The greening represents an increase in leaves on plants and trees equivalent in area to two times the continental United States. In a 2015 paper produced for the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Indur Goklany, a science and technology policy analyst who has previously represented the United States on the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally”. Carbon dioxide fertilizes plants, and emissions from fossil fuels have already had a hugely beneficial effect on crops, increasing yields by at least 10-15 percent. “This has not only been good for humankind but for the natural world too, because an acre of land that is not used for crops is an acre of land that is left for nature,” Golkany said. Increasing crops yields has helped reduce hunger and improved human well-being, Golkany said.	2
“There is nothing in the recent past that even comes close.” The US has been hit particularly hard in the last year and half, but the problem is occurring all over the world. “While Louisiana was flooding, there were also huge flood events under way in Moscow (biggest rains in 129 years of record-keeping), the Sudan, Manila, and probably plenty of other places,” climate activist Bill McKibben told the Seattle Times. The global south in particular is both more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and less equipped to deal with those effects. “There’s definitely an increase in heavy rainfall due to climate change,” John Nielsen-Gammon, the state climatologist in Texas, told The New York Times. “The actual increase from place to place is going to be variable because of the randomness of the weather.	0
“We’re trying to find cost-effective ways to do all of the above,’’ from cutting energy consumption to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The company has converted its refrigerator factory in Decatur, Ala., for use of the new blowing agent. The effect will be to eliminate emissions that are equivalent to 400,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, about the same global warming impact as 78,000 cars. The company has also applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to use a refrigerant with less global warming potential. The next step is to recapture some of the harmful gases that were locked up years ago in those foam bubbles.	1
"He said it might make sense to have Lawson talking about the economics of climate change: ""I guess he's qualified to comment on the economic arguments surrounding the cost of renewable energy. But he went on to say that renewable energy was not needed because climate change was nonsense. Global temperature had dropped in the last 10 years. Richard Black, the director of the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, recorded on Twitter a series of false or dubious statements Lawson made during the interview. As well as the ""global temperature has declined"" line, they included the claim that the UK has among the highest energy costs in the world, that the UK doesn't subsidise fossil fuels, and that there has been no increase in extreme weather events due to climate change."	2
This hearing is turning bonkers Leading the charge against Bridenstine was Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, a former astronaut, who criticized the Oklahoman’s past political rhetoric: Bridenstine said during the 2016 presidential campaign, for example, that even some Republican senators had “made this country less safe” and “destabilized the Middle East.” A conservative congressman from a deeply conservative state, Bridenstine said these older statements were part of the job of a politician, and pledged to be “apolitical” as head of NASA. His testimony also took a more mainstream stance on climate science, diverging from his past. Global temperatures had stopped rising. But just like those temperatures, which have set heat records in the last three years, Bridenstine’s views have evidently changed. “Carbon dioxide is in fact a greenhouse gas,” Bridenstine said after questioning from Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, adding that it meant more rain and flooding for the country.	2
"al write. ""However, if governments force the public to bear the external costs and even subsidize fossil fuels, carbon emissions are likely to continue to grow, with deleterious consequences for young people and future generations."" Humanity will not alter its energy course as consequences of burning all fossil fuels become clearer. ""Yet strong evidence about the dangers of human-made climate change have so far had little effect. Whether governments continue to be so foolhardy as to allow or encourage development of all fossil fuels may determine the fate of humanity."""	1
Originally, it was a hundred to one. Now, they are getting into the carbon trading market. This is a clear conflict of interest for a financial institution to both profit from financing fossil fuels and profit from carbon trading. They’re actually charging somewhere on the order of 13 percent commission on all carbon trading transactions. Now, what the World Bank could have done and should have done instead of getting into the carbon trading market is they should have set a higher energy efficiency standard, they should have stopped subsidizing fossil fuels, they should at the very least be calculating their climate footprint, which they are not doing.	1
The newspaper’s revision happened thanks to Bob Ward, policy and communications director for a climate research center at the London School of Economics and Political Science, who filed a complaint on Feb. 7 with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), an independent regulating body for member newspapers and magazines in the UK. (BuzzFeed News is not a member of the group.) NOAA researchers had used misleading data to exaggerate global warming, and failed to archive it so it couldn’t be verified. This flawed study, according to the Mail on Sunday, then “duped” world leaders into spending billions on climate action. At the same time this story went out, Bates published a blog post outlining his allegations.	2
"Sarah Palin; and climatologist David Legates, who has authored numerous papers refuting climate change with funding from Koch Industries and other fossil fuel sponsors.

Global warming causes more prostitution, barroom brawls, airline turbulence. But contrary to Morano's claims, climate change is not just a conspiracy created by scientists and politicians. It is also seen a real, imminent threat by average citizens both in the US and internationally."	0
The finding of a nearly flat increase in industrial carbon dioxide emissions, up just 0.6% last year, breaks a long-standing lockstep between economic growth and burning fossil fuels. This year looks poised to see a slight drop in emissions, even as the world economy is projected to grow more than 3%. Gor the first time, carbon dioxide emissions have stabilized, at least temporarily, while global gross domestic product grew robustly. “It's a bit of good news.” The report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, looked at carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas since 1990. Carbon dioxide is the big kahuna of greenhouse gases: It’s linked to 14 of the 15 hottest years on record coming in this century, with this year poised to break last year’s record.	1
But Venus is closer to the Sun — much closer. In fact, Venus is 25.72 million miles closer to the Sun than the Earth is. The idea that carbon emissions could turn Earth into Venus is not just laughable. Venus has a much different atmosphere, and is millions of miles closer to the Sun. Even if carbon emissions were proven to be linked to warming temperatures, and even if that rise was truly catastrophic, they would have no chance of turning the Earth into Venus.	2
TIM FLANNERY: Yeah, look, we know that in order to beat this problem we have to reduce our emissions on the order of 80 percent in the next 40 years. Now, 40 years might sound like it’s a long way off, but it isn’t really, you know. Just to drive home to people what that means, it means that in 40 years from now we can’t be driving cars that are fueled with fossil fuels, with oil. We can’t be generating our electricity by burning coal and natural gas. We have to have shifted decisively from those polluting sources of power to clean sources of power.	0
"Some 90 percent of Democrats say that global warming would have a serious effect on the earth, compared with 58 percent of Republicans, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. Other polls find a similar divide. Most scientists agree on whether global warming is happening. Among Republicans, nearly 6 in 10 say it is not a serious problem, fewer than one-quarter support increased government action, and two-thirds think there is “a lot of disagreement” among scientists. ""Everything has gotten so partisan."	1
The vast, scrabbly sheath of sea ice drifting on the Arctic Ocean ended its annual summer retreat this week, and the result was sobering. This year tied with 2007 as having the second smallest ice extent ever recorded. Of course the satellite record only goes back to 1979, seemingly leaving ample room for debate. As always, that resulted in enough interpretations and misinterpretations of Arctic conditions to suit just about anyone’s view.	1
"""So it's not so much of a model as it could be."" That same year, the World Wildlife Foundation study entitled “Norwegian Consumption, Chinese pollution“ found Norway’s appetite for imports is increasing pollution in developing nations – a predicament that is certainly not limited to the Scandinavian nation. Carbon footprint calculations do not take into account the emissions produced by goods that are imported into countries. The current proposal, by Climate Minister Helgesen’s summation, is missing some crucial details about how the nation will proceed to reach its goals. And the government will be asking parliament for more details, the Guardian says."	1
He then grins, saying that the Greens must be prepared to be mimicked across the political mainstream to succeed. The Swedish government recently adopted another Green Party idea: a vehicle tax based on carbon dioxide emissions rather than weight. Some cars (such as hybrids) are heavy, but relatively low in fossil-fuel emissions. This is the latest wrinkle in a sixteen-year-old Swedish movement toward carbon-based taxation. The country was the first in the world to adopt a carbon tax, in 1991.	1
The president’s statement was only the latest example of climate change hysteria from the president. Earlier this month, he warned that Manhattan would be “underwater” unless action was taken soon on climate change. Some portions of Manhattan could experience flooding, but not the entire island, even under the most catastrophic models. Obama also touted his administration’s record in expanding public lands and taking regulatory actions, including enforcing the Endangered Species Act (which many Californians blame for overzealous protection of the Delta smelt at the expense of water allocations to farmers). He said that every child should have the chance to visit a national park, citing his own childhood visit to Yellowstone.	1
Instead, she focuses her message on clean air, clean water, and a clean environment. Two years ago, in 2015, this moral framing of climate change had not yet resonated with most Americans, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. In the spring of that year, 10 percent of Americans viewed global warming as a religious issue. But if this reframing does take hold, it could have a widespread impact, according to the study’s authors. Americans tend to be more religious than citizens in many other industrialized nations, they write.	1
"But Trump has promised, too, to roll back Mr. Obama's Clean Power Plan, emissions restrictions that would make it more expensive for utilities to use the fuel. Such proposals would ""level the playing field for coal,"" allowing it to better compete with natural gas and renewable energies, said coal analyst Andy Roberts with the firm Wood Mackenzie. Pressure to reduce carbon dioxide emissions will continue. ""It can't just be, 'We're going to get rid of these regulations, and you guys can party until the next administration comes,' "" Cloud Peak Energy Vice President Richard Reavey said. ""There are serious global concerns about climate emissions."	1
It is just one more example of fake news by advocates pretending to be experts and reporters. We’ve already won the battle over public opinion. Human activity is responsible for most global warming. Voters rank “stopping global warming” dead last when asked to rank problems they want government to address. Some 42 percent of voters say they aren’t willing to spend even $1 a month to stop global warming.	0
On Saturday, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachussets, and chairman of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, used the unusual event to fire a salvo at Republican opponents of climate change legislation in the Senate. “An iceberg four times the size of Manhattan has broken off Greenland, creating plenty of room for global warming deniers to start their own country,” Mr. Markey said in a statement. Arctic ice is a canary in a coal mine that provides clear warnings on climate. And according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2010 is on its way to becoming the hottest year in the modern instrument record. But scientists are divided over whether the formation of the new “ice island” should be directly attributed to global warming, as Andy Revkin reports at the Dot Earth blog.	0
“There aren’t very many spaces that I can be in charge of, and what I’m going to say is going to be heard,” Margolin said. Her group is led largely by young women of color, which she said should come as no surprise, because people who are already vulnerable are going to be disproportionately hit by climate change. Women are more likely to be harmed in the kinds of natural disasters made more likely by global warming, bear greater responsibility for getting access to water, energy, and other basics of domestic life, and often are shut out of opportunities when resources decline. “If you’re a victim of a system of oppression, you’re more affected by the climate crisis — that goes for women,” she said. “Nobody is going to hand us this.	0
Even as sea ice was disappearing globally at an average rate of 13,500 square miles, or about an area the size of Maryland, every year, Antarctic sea ice went on a record streak beginning in 2012, expanding annually until reaching a new record high extent of 7.78 million square miles in fall of 2014. A new study, published Monday in Nature Geoscience, suggests that the explanation of the phenomenon lies not in the Southern Ocean itself, but in the Pacific. The expansion in Antarctic ice began to accelerate around the turn of the 21st century. At approximately the same time, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), a prolonged fluctuation in atmospheric pressure that affects sea temperatures, shifted into a negative phase, cooling the ocean surface in the tropical Pacific, with global ramifications. “When you get changes in [sea surface temperatures] in some areas of the tropics, you affect precipitation, that affects the amount of energy released in the atmosphere,” Gerald Meehl, the study’s lead author and a climate scientist with NCAR, told The Washington Post.	1
During an unparalleled heat wave, President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia steps up his climate warnings. “Everyone is talking about climate change now. Unfortunately, what is happening now in our central regions is evidence of this global climate change, because we have never in our history faced such weather conditions in the past. “This means that we need to change the way we work, change the methods that we used in the past.” [Kremlin] Russia halts grain exports as drought, heat and fire devastate crops.

"There's inertia in the system. It's putting intense pressure on 2 C.,"" Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of New South Wales in Australia, told The Guardian. Global warming could eventually reach these levels. ""The interesting thing is the scale at which we're breaking records. It's clearly all heading in the wrong direction,"" he adds."	0
These findings will no doubt come as a concern in light of the recent Paris climate talks, in which 196 countries ratified to “[Hold] the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.” However, some climate experts debate as to whether 1.5 degrees is a scientifically realistic target. They contend that it could be possible, but would require a very fast, rapid decline in global emissions. For 1.5 degrees, carbon emissions must reach zero by 2050. If the planet warms to 2 degrees Celsius, many small island nations that are either currently at or slightly below sea level, such as Malaysia, would be under greater threat from rising oceans. The European Union has said that it has not yet looked into the science and technology necessary to keep global emissions at or below 1.5 degrees Celsius, but is beginning to look into “negative emissions” technologies, including carbon capture and storage.	1
The findings are a stark contrast to the messages from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which in a report released last week concluded that in many regions of the earth, changing precipitation and melting snow are altering hydrological systems, which negatively impact the quantity of water resources. The IPCC’s report also states that climate change is forcing terrestrial, freshwater and marine species to shift their geographical ranges and migration patterns. The scientific community is under tremendous financial and peer pressure to reach the conclusion that global industry is damaging the environment. “Ethical standards have been lowered, peer review has been corrupted, and we can’t trust peers in our most prestigious journals anymore,” Joe Bast, President and CEO of Heartland Institute, told Fox News. However, scientists are questioning the credibility of the NIPCC’s findings.	1
On my visit to Seattle, I ran into Adam Wolfensohn, co-managing partner of the investment firm Encourage Capital. He is among those concerned that the pursuit of energy miracles, if seen as the only path, might weaken support for other efforts. Radical innovation in low-carbon energy technology is critical to long term climate mitigation. But he said he and others are exploring the creation of an investors’ coalition, “complementary to the Gates initiative,” aimed at overcoming a different set of barriers to progress. “Financing renewables is fundamentally different than fossil energy,” he said, noting, for example, that different investment vehicles are needed when there is a high capital cost up front and extremely low costs for energy in the end.	0
"In 2017 the world's temperature rose 1C above pre-industrial temperatures. The IPCC report states that in order to keep global temperatures below the Paris Climate Agreement cap, the world must achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Earlier this year painted a bleaker portrait than the IPCC, stating that without a ""decisive shift"" by 2030 the globe will pass the point of no return and be unable to keep the global temperature rise to below 2C. While three-quarters of Australians are concerned about global warming, the emotional toll can be greatest for those who work in environmental research and activism. Dr Sally Gillespie is an academic from Western Sydney University and a retired therapist."	0
"""As we head into the busiest and warmest part of the season the cave is in its most dangerous state,"" said Lead Field Ranger Matthew Riggen. ""The cave is in a condition that we would normally not see until at least September – large, inviting and collapsing."" The ice is prone to collapse because of warmer weather. On Sunday, another section of the Big Four Ice Caves collapsed and was captured on video. No one was injured during that collapse."	0
“We don’t pay that much attention to what media critics say, but that was a piece where we had 80 percent of our commenters weigh in negatively, so we’re commissioning a rebuttal to that piece,” said Silver. “We listen to the people who actually give us legs.” The piece in question was the debut by his resident climate expert, Roger Pielke, Jr., arguing that there was no evidence to support claims by alarmists that “extreme weather events” are on the increase and doing more damage than ever before. Mankind is contributing to global warming but is not yet convinced that this contribution will be catastrophic. But neither his scientific bona fides (he was Director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder) nor his measured, fact-based delivery were enough to satisfy the ravening green-lust of FiveThirtyEight’s mainly liberal readership. Here’s a taste of some of the comments: Pielke is just a disaster as an analyst.	1
These should be wake-up calls: No, the world is not ending, but this is how the world operates,” Pielke says. Titley, from Penn State, agrees. There is no evidence I’ve seen from any climate scientist that says hurricanes are going to get weaker, or seas will come down, or air is going to get drier. “And a lesson from the past eight weeks is, we are not ready for today’s weather, let alone tomorrow’s weather.” Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Pielke suggests that we should have the same sort of post-mortem on disasters, and what can be done better, that we have for airplane crashes.	2
"The deep layers of permanently frozen soil that underlie much of the Arctic hide massive reservoirs of organic carbon, in the form of thousands of years&apos; worth of trapped plant matter and even animal carcasses. As the soil gradually melts, these buried organisms will decay and release the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, which can, in turn, lead to even more warming. It would take decades of warming to melt permafrost buried beneath the active layer of soil that freezes and thaws with the seasons. ""The conclusions that permafrost-carbon modelers were reaching was that, until you thaw really deep, we&apos;re not going to get this large, old carbon signal and that the really deep thaw of carbon on land is not going to happen until beyond 2100,"" study leader Katey Walter Anthony, an ecologist and biogeochemist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Live Science. ""What our study shows is that in a lake, you thaw that deep really fast on a scale of decades."	1
The problem of skyrocketing health care costs will be resolved not by a government program but by offloading the vast majority of every day medical functions to intelligent robots. Robots will also be used regularly for warfare in that time frame. The seas will rise by a few inches by 2100, but that prediction is as ridiculous as a 1910 prediction that the world would be covered by horse droppings by 2000. Technology is moving too quickly for any such prediction to be relevant. New computer technologies will solve resolve any climate change issues in the 2020s in ways that today cannot be predicted.	2
Adler said that both environmental writer Bill McKibben and Steyer having to respond to Core News show the effort has made an impact. “I guess I see it as a way for them to distract from having to deal with the reality of climate change,” McKibben told BuzzFeed News by email. This summer is seeing record lows for Arctic ice. I guess I get why they'd want to change the subject.” Whether Core News represents a new evolution in opposition research, or is simply political operatives seeking to package research they couldn’t unload in any other way is tough to tell, said Nick Surgey of PR Watch. “They just launched it, so maybe this is just a testing the water phase, but I agree it’s quite unimpressive so far, both in terms of content and impact,” he said.	1
Scientific analysis pointing to a human role in warming the climate through burning fossil fuels. Check out his 1938 paper on the subject: “The Artificial Production of Carbon Dioxide and Its Influence on Temperature.” By 1956, The New York Times was writing on combustion-driven global warming. But when did news coverage begin?	1
It reflects the averaged output of the world's leading climate models, given starting conditions in 1900 and then left to simulate how the atmosphere and oceans behave until 2100. Each frame shows precipitation over a five-year period. Carbon dioxide emissions will remain on their current upward trajectory, leveling out only toward the end of the century. This is a scenario that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls RCP8.5. If this is what the world allows to happen, climate models indicate that average global temperatures are likely to rise by about five degrees Celsius by 2100.	1
Hopefully, Inslee’s presence as a candidate will keep that from happening again. In fact, there is plenty of evidence that ordinary Americans, subjected to increasingly bizarre and devastating weather events, care about addressing the issue of climate change. A majority of Americans feel that global climate change is either extremely or very important. The survey also reveals that 75 percent of Democratic voters believe that climate change is an issue that they care deeply about. Inslee could make the case that climate change affects both health outcomes and local economies across the U.S.	1
"He added that the suit is ""based on discredited and inaccurate claims by activists"" about the company's four-decade history of climate change research. ""To suggest that we had reached definitive conclusions, decades before the world’s experts and while climate science was in an early stage of development, is not credible,"" he said. Through the 1980s, Exxon researched the emerging science of man-made climate change by, among other things, modeling increases in global temperatures due to carbon dioxide emissions. Over the next decade, the company quietly took that understanding of higher global temperatures into account when building pipelines over thawing permafrost and offshore platforms over rising seas. The Conservation Law Foundation argues that ExxonMobil failed to use that foreknowledge to fortify the Everett station against the effects of rising sea levels."	1
As far back as 2005, I wrote about young people pressing climate treaty negotiators for not taking into account the concerns of younger generations. I’m looking for more recent data, but in 2010 researchers at Yale and George Mason University came to this conclusion after a climate survey: [T]he conventional wisdom holds that young Americans, growing up in a world of ever more certain scientific evidence, increasing news attention, alarming entertainment portrayals, and school-based curricula, should be more engaged with and concerned about the issue of climate change than older Americans. Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 are, for the most part, split on the issue of global warming and, on some indicators, relatively disengaged when compared to older generations. Will this change? Ask someone under 20.	1
Related: 2015 on pace to be hottest year after November proves to be scorcher Last month, NOAA reported that November Arctic sea ice was 360,000 square miles or 8.3 percent below the 1981-2010 average. This was the sixth smallest November extent since records began in 1979, according to analysis by the National Snow and Ice Data Center using data from NOAA and NASA. It is cold and dark in the Arctic so it will revert to its colder temperatures. “But every warm air moving into the Arctic keeps it from getting really cold like it used to. It has a minor, long-term effect, thinner ice and warmer temperatures overall.”	1
So, I think that’s very disingenuous. And I think it’s very important to understand again that we have a really short time for action. We now have 380 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Traditionally that number was 280. When it reaches 400 parts per million, which will be within the next 10-15 years, that correlates with an increase of 2 degrees Celsius in the average global temperature, and that is the point at which a lot of impacts begin to sort of take on their own momentum and become runaway impacts.	1
Meanwhile, in sub-Saharan Africa, deforestation caused by unregulated agricultural practices and illegal logging leads to an uptick in desertification-linked water problems, poor air quality, and nutritional or other diseases. Here’s a look at some of the efforts under way to stem the risks. Around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation from agricultural expansion and destructive logging practices, among other factors. In response, the international community is working to help strengthen rule of law and crack down on the nefarious practices that lead to deforestation in countries around the world. “Good governance, less corruption, and general rule of law in the forest sector really helps to ensure everything produced is both sustainable and legal according to the country’s legal framework,” says Naomi Basik Treanor, manager of the forest law and governance program at Forest Trends, a nonprofit that works to conserve forests and other natural ecosystems.	1
In this election cycle – where candidates paint every topic in extremes – the poles seem even farther apart. The truth is muddier. A broad swath of both Democrats and Republicans supports efforts to bolster clean energy and to limit carbon emissions from power plants. Data also suggest Americans support oil exports, nuclear energy, and, to a lesser degree, hydraulic fracturing. It’s a far cry from what’s said from the debate stage – where candidates question climate science or call for wholesale bans on fracking.	1
Yet, for all the environmental climate literacy foisted onto K-12 classrooms, it continues to be shrouded in factual controversy. In 2012, the Wall Street Journal printed an open letter from 16 respected scientists who disputed global warming. Perhaps the most inconvenient fact is the lack of global warming for well over 10 years now. This is known to the warming establishment, as one can see from the 2009 ‘Climategate’ email of climate scientist Kevin Trenberth, who wrote that ‘The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t. '” According to the letter, the earth’s warming was only happening if “one believes computer models where so-called feedbacks involving water vapor and clouds greatly amplify the small effect of CO2.” Not only did the Wall Street Journal letter call out how “those promoting alarm” shifted from planetary warming to climate changing “weather extremes to enable anything unusual that happens in our chaotic climate to be ascribed to CO2,” they punctuated the unfounded hysteria with the fact that “CO2 is not a pollutant.” Still, climate change mania in the United States has influenced public school science standards.	2
Countries need incentives to change their behavior,” says Dr. Barrett. “Right now countries write [INDCs] to make themselves look good.” Using the threat of sanctions to ensure countries meet their commitments, however, is largely off the table, since most negotiators agree that countries would be hesitant to sign off on an agreement that includes punitive measures. The current commitments are insufficient to limit global warming to 2 degrees C. It helps explain why the draft accord stipulates that nations should reevaluate their greenhouse gas limits every 5 years, a provision that environmentalists pushed for during a negotiating session in Bonn in early September. Still, many say that instating monetary incentives, such as a global carbon tax or bottom price for carbon emissions, is the only effective way to ensure that countries reduce their emissions enough to avoid irreversible damage to the environment.	0
However, a study last year found that sea levels have not risen by as much as previously predicted. Oceanographer William P de Lange and marine geologist Bob Carter said there was little evidence to support claims, such as those by Al Gore, that the sea would rise by 20 feet by the end of the century. No justification exists for continuing to base sea-level policy and coastal management regulation upon the outcomes of deterministic or semi-empirical sea-level modelling. “Such modelling remains speculative rather than predictive. The practice of using a global rate of sea-level change to manage specific coastal locations worldwide is irrational and should be abandoned.”	1
President Obama is earning criticism for Earth Day plans that include taking Air Force One to the Everglades in Florida to serve as a backdrop for his latest speech about his fears of global warming. Global warming is damaging tourism and people’s health. The President has also said that climate change is a national security risk. “The Everglades is one of the most special places in our country,” Obama said during his Saturday weekly address.	0
Using executive authority, Mr. Obama has pledged to cut emissions from power plants, cars, trucks, and airplanes. Those policies are the US contribution toward the Paris talks, and will be combined with the rest of the world’s pledges to reach a final deal come December. That’s what we’re going to use to push other countries to join in global climate action. To bolster the case for addressing climate change, the US Environmental Protection Agency rolled out a report Monday touting the public health and economic benefits of reducing greenhouse emissions. The report finds that tackling climate change will avoid “12,000 deaths annually associated with extreme temperatures in 49 U.S. cities, compared to a future with no reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.” The study also finds the US could save $7 billion dollars annually by 2100 in road maintenance alone if international action is taken on climate.	0
One member group of this 54 group organization, the A.P.I., paid $1.8 million to a public relations firm on this issue, and by comparison, the five biggest environmental groups that also focused on climate change spent a total of $2 million, according to their own organizations. So there’s a huge mismatch in terms of the financial issues that — the financial outlays in terms of fighting this battle for reality, basically, and for the public perception. We have about a ten-year window to make very, very deep cuts in our carbon fuel use. He speaks normally in very conservative and measured language. So, to hear that kind of talk is very, very troubling.	0
"That was January, and then February broke that record, which is based not on average temperature but on deviations from the norms. In March, the Northern Hemisphere reached the milestone mark of 3.6 degrees above normal preindustrial levels for the first time ever. Global warning, and not El Niño, has caused the record highs. ""The interesting thing is the scale at which we're breaking records,"" Andy Pitman, a climatologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia told The Guardian. ""It's clearly all heading in the wrong direction."""	0
We think we can adapt and cope, and in many ways we can do so more than developing economies. “We also talk about global averages and that’s a difficult term for many people because two degrees doesn’t seem like a lot. The more educated a population is about climate change, the more sceptical it is likely to be about claims that global warming will have catastrophic effects. “The new survey confirms once again what numerous surveys have found in recent years: educated and informed people in in the Western world are generally sceptical about alarmist climate predictions. While they accept basic science, they no longer trust climate scientists to tell the truth,” he said.	2
With an IDP, you don’t give up any rights, you don’t give up your citizenship, your legal protections. You retain all of that.” Yet even as climate change contributes to this population by the day, there remain many unknowns. Around 250 million people will be displaced globally by climate change by the year 2050. And while headlines often use the term “climate refugee,” those fleeing climate impacts are not protected by refugee status as it is defined by the U.N. Similarly, the internally displaced lack the certain rights granted to refugees.	0
He has been described as being in the league of all-time great explorers such as David Livingstone. Flannery might be best known as the author of the bestselling book “The Weather Makers: The History and Future Impact of Climate Change.” Earlier this year he was named 2007 Australian of the Year. Global warming could wipe out more than half the earth’s species in the next few centuries. That finding appears in a new study published by researchers at the University of York. Scientists examined the relationship between climate and extinction rates over the past 500 million years.	0
“We can turn things around. We are still in the zone to turn our economy to making money off climate solutions versus making it worse.” But time is running out fast. The world only had a few decades, if even, to keep global future warming below 2 degrees Celsius and prevent practically all coral reefs from dying, more substantial sea level rise, and other catastrophic impacts.

“I firmly believe [it will be difficult to reduce] emissions from shale gas, and so we need to accelerate the move to renewable energy and get rid of all fossil fuels…as quickly as possible,” he concludes. The latest emissions study is one of a number of recent efforts by scholars to understand the sources and effects of methane. Reservoirs may account for 1.3 percent of global methane emissions. This has raised concerns about the environmental viability of hydropower, particularly large hydropower projects, which has been the renewable energy source of choice for many developing countries. Researchers say that global assessments need to be adjusted again to account for these findings, which in turn will help produce better policy.	1
In the IPCC, the models characterize a future in which tropical forests at the high range of warming have a potential to release large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. One of the new numbers that’s a great concern to me is that we’ve been doing studies of how much organic matter is stored in these frozen soils in northern latitudes, permafrost soils, and the new numbers are that approximately a billion tons of carbon is stored in the organic matter in these high latitude soils. At high amounts of warming large fractions of the permafrost could melt, and some of the projections have that at from 60 to 90 percent of the permafrost melting. And the surprising thing about these permafrost soils is that the organic matter that’s contained within them is not this incredibly stabilized, difficult-to-decompose stuff; it’s basically frozen plants that have been sitting there for, in some cases, tens of thousands of years. And when the permafrost is thawed, these plants decompose quite quickly, releasing their carbon as CO2 to the atmosphere or as methane to the atmosphere, which is a greenhouse gas that, on a molecule per molecule basis, is about twenty-five times as powerful as CO2.	1
But because of the situation related to poverty and the global distribution of wealth, we are seeing that the countries that are paying the price for industrialization are actually in the Global South, and especially South Asia.” The urgency around climate change is pushing some newer immigrants to civic involvement for the first time. At Brown and Green, a loose network that includes teachers and engineers, members have not only marched and rallied but also joined local activists across the bay in Richmond, California, in fighting to reduce pollution from the large Chevron refinery there. We see often that the so-called villains of the large scale, often oil companies, are operating both at the local level and at the global level. “We need to fight them at all of those levels.” The urgency around climate change is pushing some newer immigrants to civic involvement for the first time. “We need to become involved in the political process of this country.	1
University president Janet Napolitano assured California Gov. Jerry Brown and other summit participants that the university’s 10 campuses will continue to act as “living laboratories” for climate change solutions. Addressing these challenges, and reducing our carbon footprint, is a moral imperative. Through the Carbon Neutrality Initiative, announced by Napolitano in 2013, UC is committed to making all buildings and vehicles associated with its 10 campuses carbon neutral by 2025. To successfully emit net zero greenhouse gases in 10 years, the University of California will primarily focus on energy and food waste.	0
Staying home is cheaper than I thought, which is nice for us as individuals but maybe not so nice for society. Now, since we live in Texas, our electricity bill is far higher –- as much as five times higher — during our hot summers than during our mild winters. Like electricity should be more expensive if we want to burn fewer fossil fuels for power generation and do something to curb global warming. Looking on the other side of the ledger, we spend a higher percentage of our electricity dollars than I thought on appliances that are plugged into the wall that we are not using – like digital clocks on televisions and stoves that light up at all times. The smart meter that makes my new utility weekly update possible should eventually make the electric car and other energy improvements more practical.	0
"The IPCC said the evidence of climate change has grown thanks to more and better observations, a clearer understanding of the climate system and improved models to analyze the impact of rising temperatures. ""Our assessment of the science finds that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice has diminished, the global mean sea level has risen and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,"" said Qin Dahe, co-chair of the working group that wrote the report. Climate models have failed to accurately predict global temperatures. A study in the journal Nature Climate Change compared 117 climate predictions made in the 1990&apos;s to the actual amount of warming. Out of 117 predictions, the study’s author told FoxNews.com, 3 were roughly accurate and 114 overestimated the amount of warming."	2
"Although Carney said at a press briefing last month that the administration had ""no intention of proposing a carbon tax,"" Waxman made the case that putting a price on carbon could actually appeal to Republicans and private sector business leaders. ""Putting a price on carbon is a very important way to give an incentive to the private sector to develop technologies and take actions through market incentives through which they'll benefit,"" said Waxman. There are a lot of Republican economists who would like us to put a price on carbon. ""They see that a cap and trade or carbon tax could git in their view of, 'When we tax the things we don't want, we'll get less of it.' That can help us deal with the environmental problem that is so urgent, but it can also help reduce our deficit."""	1
All of this bolsters a notion I first floated awhile ago on Twitter, related to a 1978 proposal by an Exxon scientist, Harold N. Weinberg: Maybe @exxonmobil can answer Weinberg’s ’78 call by filling RD&D gap on scalable CO2 removal //t.co/eQo5MmdmfN //t.co/6eKhcBqTxI — Andy Revkin (@Revkin) 18 Oct 15 In a memo to superiors, revealed in InsideClimate’s earlier reporting, Weinberg wrote: “What would be more appropriate than for the world’s leading energy company and leading oil company [to] take the lead in trying to define whether a long-term CO2 problem really exists and, if so, what counter measures would be appropriate.” The proposal was not embraced, needless to say. While others pursue investigations that may or may not bear fruit (but will surely enrich several generations of lawyers), I have an idea for something that could start now. Exxon, and perhaps the fossil fuel industry more generally, might help propel a vigorous new burst of research in ways to take back the CO2 added to the atmosphere by fossil fuel combustion at a scale that would matter to the climate system. (Those of us who benefitted from decades of cheap fossil fuels can do our part by supporting boosted federal investments in clean-energy science and technology development — and, yes, deployment.) After all, the putative trajectories for avoiding dangerous climate change that were the centerpiece of discussions and pledges in the Paris climate treaty talks all rely on as-yet-untested massive atmospheric CO2 removal sometime late in this century.	1
There, glaciers have retreated an average of 1,300 feet since 1962, the team found. More recently, precipitation (both snow and rain) has dropped by 3.9 inches and temperatures have risen 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1992. The researchers suspect that the glacial melting in the Everest region is due to global warming, but they have not yet established a firm connection between the mountains&apos; changes and climate change. While Everest isn&apos;t the only Himalayan region seeing the effects of climate change, not all of the region&apos;s glaciers are melting. The Karakoram Mountains, on the China-India-Pakistan border, are holding steady and may even be growing.	1
The US intel­­li­­gence community, for example, recently wrote a National Intelligence Assessment on the national security impacts of global climate change through 2030. Another presidential report prepared by the US intelligence community, Global Trends 2025, has climate change as a top talking point. Global climate change will have important and extensive implications for US national security interests over the next 20 years. In December, the Pentagon unveiled a controversial program to fund social science research. The $50 million research fund, known as Minerva, is funding work at the University of Texas at Austin to study the effects of climate change on the security of African nations.	0
"Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. For his part, Schmidt says he expects the slowdown to speed up sooner rather than later. The increase in greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and from land-use changes ""is unrelenting, and that, in the end, is going to dominate most of the other things that are going on"" that contribute to the slowdown. ""In five or 10 years' time, greenhouse gases dominate those things."""	0
"Doubled water usage Freshwater has always been a scarce commodity in the semi-arid Mediterranean. It has 7 percent of the world's population, but only 3 percent of its freshwater resources. Global warming may lead to less rainfall and more evaporation in the region, further reducing the supply of water. Half the world's ""water poor"" – that is, people whose access to freshwater is deemed inadequate – live in the Mediterranean region, mostly on the sea's eastern and southern shores. By 2025, the Blue Plan predicts that due to population growth and expanding agriculture, the number of water poor in the region could be as high as 165 million in 2025, up from 108 million in 2000."	0
That&apos;s largely because of a long-time-scale weather pattern called the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which is masking the global effect. That, however, could reverse in the coming years, Willis said. In the long run, we expect the sea levels on the west coast to catch up to global mean and even exceed the global mean. Florida is also particularly vulnerable to sea level rise because its porous soil allows more seawater intrusion than does the soil in other coastal areas, Willis said.

So here’s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers. Although Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. A carbon tax is politically toxic. Governor Inslee, he said, is “going to find out real quickly that it doesn’t play in Peoria.” Even some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. “I would like to see him run,” said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat.	1
Also, the involvement of the dairy industry highlights the ranching industry's absence from the White House plan. While dairy cows are reared and milked indoors, where their ruminant gases can plausibly be gathered, beef cattle in outdoor feedlots do not present the same methane-recycling opportunities. Such tweaks will not be nearly enough to curb global warming. The plan's own emphasis on preparing for climate change seems to acknowledge this. The world leaders who drafted the 2009 Copenhagen Accord determined that worldwide, a rise of two degrees celsius above pre-industrial temperatures was the absolute upper limit the planet could approach while still avoiding catastrophic climate change.	0
Con Ed will raise flood walls, bury some vital equipment and conduct a study of whether emerging climate risks require even more changes. Other utilities in the state face similar requirements, and utility regulators across the United States are discussing whether to follow New York’s lead. But with a global failure to limit greenhouse gases, the risk is rising that climatic changes in coming decades could overwhelm such efforts to adapt. It cited a particular risk that in a hotter climate, farmers will not be able to keep up with the fast-rising demand for food. “When supply falls below demand, somebody doesn’t have enough food,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University climate scientist who helped write the new report.	0
In the United States, emissions rose 2.9 percent, after declining in recent years. The new numbers, reported by a tracking initiative called the Global Carbon Project and published in the journal Nature Geoscience, came on the eve of a United Nations summit meeting meant to harness fresh political ambition in tackling climate change. Vastly greater efforts would be needed to get long-term global warming within tolerable limits. “You can no longer have some countries go first and others come in later, because there is no more time,” said Glen P. Peters, a scientist at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, who helped compile the new numbers. “It needs to be all hands on deck now.” Yet expectations for the summit meeting on Tuesday are low, with no sign of any political breakthrough that would lead to more ambitious efforts.	0
Other scientists have predicted that Montana's Glacier National Park will be devoid of glaciers by 2030. Worldwide, the vast majority of glaciers measured below 15,000 feet have been shrinking in recent decades, said Richard Armstrong, a senior researcher with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The rate at which they are diminishing is more or less parallel to the increase in the rate of global warming. University of Wyoming civil engineering graduate students Jake Edmunds, Derrick Thompson, and Jeb Bell found that Teton Glacier on 13,776-foot Grand Teton has lost about20 percent of its surface area over the past 40 years or so. Middle Teton Glacier on 12,804-foot Middle Teton has lost about 25 percent of its surface area.	0
“We are past the point of debating the existence of climate change and are now focusing on adapting to current and future threats.” In the face of encroaching saltwater and sunny-day flooding like that on Alton Road, Mr. Levine has supported a $400 million spending project to make the city’s drainage system more resilient in the face of rising tides. But while local politicians can take action to shore up their community against the rising tide, they are powerless to stop what scientists say is the heart of the problem: the increasing fossil fuel emissions that continue to warm the planet. The scale of emission reductions necessary to prevent the most dangerous effects of global warming can only come as a result of national and international policies to cut carbon pollution. Some areas of the globe are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and inhabitants are being forced to make stark changes in their lives. In particular, climate experts say, national policies to tax or regulate carbon pollution are required by the world’s top emitters, chiefly the United States and China.	0
"The biggest uncertainty: how quickly humans move to curb greenhouse-gas emissions – most notably carbon dioxide – in terms of fossil-fuel and land-use changes. For now, however, ""communities can begin to use this as part of their adaptation planning,"" she says. Several factors combine to determine sea-level rise in any one location. Local wind and ocean-circulation patterns, and even the West Coast's shifting crustal plates, which generate earthquakes and raise volcanoes, can play a role. A magnitude 8 quake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone off the Pacific Northwest, for instance, could significantly change a coastal community's height above sea level within seconds, according to the study."	1
In the early church, Lent was a time to prepare new converts for baptism. Today, Christians focus on their relationship with God, often choosing to give up something or to volunteer and give of themselves for others,” the United Methodist Church website states. Global warming is such an important issue they are giving up carbon for Lent. Yale Climate Connections reports: The weeks just before Easter are known as Lent. It’s a time when many Christians fast or give up luxuries.	0
But to Robert D. Bullard, a professor at Texas Southern University who some call the “father of environmental justice,” the industrial revival that Mr. Trump has promised could come with some serious downsides for an already warming planet. Professor Bullard is trying to bring that message to working-class Americans like Mr. Guerra, and to environmental organizations that have, in his mind, been more focused on struggling animals than poor humans, who have been disproportionately harmed by increasing temperatures, worsening storms and rising sea levels. For too long, a lot of the climate change and global warming arguments have been looking at melting ice and polar bears and not at the human suffering side of it. “They are still pushing out the polar bear as the icon for climate change. The icon should be a kid who is suffering from the negative impacts of climate change and increased air pollution, or a family where rising water is endangering their lives.” The “environmental justice movement” has, in fact, caught on with major environmental groups, but it has far to go before it begins moving the dial in the nation’s politics.	1
The Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution, leaving an opening for President Obama to approve the politically divisive project. The department’s long-awaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria Mr. Obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would not “significantly exacerbate” the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Although the pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day from Canada to the Gulf Coast, the report appears to indicate that if it were not built, carbon-heavy oil would still be extracted at the same rate from pristine Alberta forest and transported to refineries by rail instead.	1
The latest is that Al Gore has joined Bill Clinton in animal-free land, though there are the inevitable reports that maybe Clinton cheats. (Not that there’s anything wrong with that.) The typical American diet of something like 600 pounds of animal products a year is inconsistent with a progressive or even realistic view of slowing global warming. Or maybe he just wanted to lose some weight. Or both — he didn’t respond when I emailed him.	1
"In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama said the gas industry's cleanliness and economic promise proved ""that we don't have to choose between our environment and our economy."" In contrast, this new initiative is ""another sign of the President’s commitment to confronting the climate crisis at a time of partisan gridlock in Washington,"" said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, in a press statement. Methane pollution is an intense contributor to global climate change, and the White House methane strategy is a smart roadmap for taking on the biggest sources of emissions, including natural gas leaks from the oil and gas sector. The BLM estimates that 59 percent of coal is mined on private lands, and gas companies are rapidly buying residential parcels in shale-rich areas. Also, the involvement of the dairy industry highlights the ranching industry's absence from the White House plan."	1
Global warming caused by human emissions has most likely intensified the drought in California by 15 to 20 percent. Even though the findings suggest that the drought is primarily a consequence of natural climate variability, the scientists added that the likelihood of any drought becoming acute is rising because of climate change. The odds of California suffering droughts at the far end of the scale, like the current one that began in 2012, have roughly doubled over the past century, they said.	0
As a result of climate change, national parks are seeing extended fire seasons, species migration, and increased snow melt, he says. Researchers and park officers outlined some of their concerns this week to a congressional subcommittee at a special hearing on the “Impacts of Climate Change on America’s National Parks” here in Twentynine Palms, Calif. M. Rebecca Shaw, director of conservation for the Nature Conservancy of California, told the panel, “An explosion of studies in the last five years has documented observed climate impacts on species distributions, wildfire frequency and intensity, pest outbreaks, and sea-level rise.” “Keeping wildlife populations, rivers, forests, deserts, and our national parks healthy will allow us to support nearly 6.5 million existing jobs and continue to generate $88 billion in state and national tax revenue,” Cipra told the panel, pointing to a 2006 study by the Outdoor Industry Association, which found that fishing, hunting, hiking, and other outdoor pursuits contribute $730 billion annually to the US economy. Global warming exists. “These scientists know that if they do research and the results are in no way alarming, their research will gather dust on the shelf and their research careers will languish,” said Mr. Coleman. Nevertheless, committee chairman Rep. Raul M. Grijalva (D) of Arizona said he is proposing substantial funding to help mitigate the effects of global warming on national parks.	0
Still, the panel observes that some regions have seen a decline in the number of deaths related to exposure to cold, while the number of deaths attributed to heat have risen. And the distribution of some water-borne illnesses and the insects that spread them has expanded to new areas. Overall, evidence for global warming's effect on the planet is most obvious in changes to natural systems. As for the future, one concern centers on the rates of change projected if emissions follow projections built on plausible medium to high emission rates. If emissions follow any of those trajectories, that presents a high risk of abrupt, irreversible changes to regional ecosystems and the services they provide, including the sequestration of carbon dioxide and methane.	0
"A team of European researchers are out with a new study that will ""infuriate"" climate change activists warning of melting glaciers as a result of global warming. The earth is likely to undergo a ""mini ice age"" that may last about a decade. Northumbria University professor Valentina Zharkova said it's something that hasn't been experienced since the 1600s and that the freeze could occur between 2030 and 2040. ""Their findings will infuriate environmental campaigners who argue by 2030 we could be facing increased sea levels and flooding due to glacial melt at the poles,"" the British newspaper, Express, reported."	0
"“Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope,” said Professor Chris Rapley, from University College London. ""I do hope we are wrong."" We could soon reach a point where global warming is irreversible, leading to a ""hothouse"" effect where parts of Earth are uninhabitable. pic.twitter.com/UqntwT3dTm — AJ+ (@ajplus) August 7, 2018 The paper paints a terrifying picture. It does a masterful job of compiling the evidence (some of which we’ve known for a long time) that our worst climate fears could come true and persist for millennia if Earth is just slightly more sensitive to greenhouse gases than we think."	0
"That concern, in turn, helped elevate the polar bear to climate-icon status and reportedly fed into then-President George W. Bush's decision in 2008 to list the bear as ""threatened"" under the Endangered Species Act. The new study, however, finds no ""tipping point"" now or in this century in Arctic sea-ice decline, but rather a relatively steady fall-off in ice extent as average temperatures increase. This gives cause for hope that once greenhouse-gas concentrations stabilize, the average temperatures in the Arctic would respond in ways that would keep the sea ice from declining further, although natural shifts in seasonal weather patterns would continue to play its role in varying sea-ice extent from one year to the next. ""Polar bears do not appear to be doomed by what we have contributed already"" to atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, says Cecilia Bitz, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle and a member of the team reporting its results in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. But, she cautions, ""they [the bears] will be"" if greenhouse-gas emissions follow – or exceed, as they have this decade – ""business as usual"" growth trajectories."	2
And as for carbon taxes, even if the U.S. imposed one on itself, it would have virtually no effect on the global climate. Hamilton steered me to an article by James Manzi and Peter Wehner in his favorite magazine, National Affairs. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the expected economic costs of unaddressed global warming over the next century are likely to be about 3 percent of world gross domestic product. This is a big, gradual problem, but not the sort of cataclysmic immediate threat that’s likely to lead people to suspend their immediate self-interest. Well, I ventured, if you’re skeptical about our own policies, Mr.	1
"In essence, air was rising over the warm waters, setting up a region of low pressure over the Atlantic and a region of falling air – high pressure – over the eastern Pacific. ""This pressure difference intensifies the equatorial Pacific trade winds, which in turn suck up colder water in the eastern Pacific and pile up warm water in the western Pacific,"" explains University of Hawaii oceanographer Axel Timmermann, a member of the team conducting the study. The hiatus in measured global warming could persist. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Each phase of the variations they see in the Atlantic's thermohaline circulation lasts on average about 30 years."	1
The South Carolina Electric and Gas Company said it would release water through its hydroelectric dam on Lake Murray before the storm to lower the water level in the reservoir and head off flooding. Climate change is probably contributing to the menace posed by storms like Florence. While many scientists are wary of drawing firm links between any particular storm and climate change, a rising sea level adds to the destructiveness of storm surges, and a warming atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to more rain. A study last December estimated that Hurricane Harvey’s rainfall total last year was 38 percent higher than it would have been in a world without climate change. The storm’s rising strength may also be influenced by climate change, according to Jennifer Francis, a research professor at Rutgers University.	0
By 2030, the government wants Singapore to measure nearly 300 square miles. But reclaiming land from the ocean has its limits, particularly in an age of a warming planet. By 2100, sea levels may rise by as much as six feet, and furious storms will pound our coasts. All over the world, the governments of small islands are working to respond to these hazards. Kiribati, an island nation in the Central Pacific, has bought 6,000 acres of forested land in Fiji, more than a thousand miles away, hoping to resettle some of its 100,000 people if a crisis hits.	0
For decades, many climate experts were relatively sanguine on the issue, thinking that warming in frigid northern countries would benefit crops, helping to offset likely production losses in the tropics. Moreover, some research suggested potentially huge crop gains from a sort of counterintuitive ace in the hole: the very increase in carbon dioxide that is causing the planet to warm. Higher carbon dioxide levels in the future might give crops a major boost. But that work was done under artificial conditions, such as in greenhouses. Researchers in various places, including at the University of Illinois, saw a need for tests under more real-world conditions.	2
"""It really looks like beef is a lot worse environmentally than these other meats,"" said Ken Caldeira, an environmental scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science. Caldeira wasn't part of this study, but has a separate study of beef's greenhouse gas footprint around the world, published this month in the journal Climatic Change. The average American who switches from beef to pork would reduce the equivalent of 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide a year, which is about nine days' worth of the nation's per capita greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA calculates that it is the same as the emissions from 61 gallons of gas or what comes out of the smokestack from burning 580 pounds of coal. Caldeira said his calculations found that ""eating a pound of beef causes more greenhouse warming than burning a gallon of gasoline."""	1
"Distracting from the news that Arctic sea-ice extent reached a record low on Sept.16 is a widely circulating blog article claiming that at the opposite end of the Earth, Antarctic sea ice is more than making up for the losses. In the post, climate change skeptic and blogger Steven Goddard states that Antarctic sea ice reached its highest level ever recorded for the 256th day of the calendar year on Sept. 12. The Southern Hemisphere must be balancing the warming of the Northern Hemisphere by becoming colder (and thus, net global warming is zero). The National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC), which tracks sea ice using satellite data, explains on its website why Antarctic ice has weathered global warming more robustly than Arctic ice. Goddard dismisses the explanation, concluding instead, ""Antarctic and Arctic ice move opposite each other."	2
Noon introduces the book’s three authors as “highly regarded climate scientists.” Not quite true. Despite their academic credentials, none have the publication record of an accomplished expert in the field, though they may be lauded by the conservative media. Some legitimate uncertainty about the human contribution to global warming did exist within my specialty of paleoclimatology several decades ago. Since then, however, high-quality climate reconstructions from ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments and other geological sources, coupled with rigorous analyses of solar activity, volcanism and fossil fuel emissions, have made it clear that the recent warming is not simply a result of natural variability or cycles. Long after the newer, better data convinced me and the vast majority of other climate scientists of the powerful human role in global warming, climate-change deniers still cling to the outdated idea of natural causes.	1
Much of the variation in cost assumptions may be due to different predictions about the speed with which new, greener industries and technologies will arise and the extent to which US consumers will embrace their products. Many supporters of legislative action also argue that the worst-case cost scenarios ignore the price of inaction. Global warming could result in expensive increases in hurricane damage and other climate-related costs. “Climate change is on a collision course with the US economy, long before the end of the century, unless we act now,” said Frank Ackerman, a Tufts University economist and coauthor of a recent study on the economic effects of global warming, on May 22. That’s not the way the White House sees things.	0
Thus, for the Mississippi Delta the global-warming component to sea level rise, while important, has been outpaced by subsidence. Along the East Coast's hot spot, by contrast, the team's measurements suggest that subsidence isn't a significant player in the acceleration it found. The pace is most consistent with the slowing of Atlantic currents along the coast, either from warming waters, melting ice, or some combination. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. The take-home messages, he says: “Acceleration is indeed happening within the United States and can be seen in data,” and sea-level rise does not manifest itself the same way everywhere; it's not like filling a bathtub.	1
“There’s room for wringing inefficiency out of the petroleum sector, even as we continue to rely on petroleum,” says David Livingston, an associate in the energy and climate program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank. “What this project reveals is the scope there is to achieve climate mitigation in the existing petroleum sector.” That project is Carnegie’s new oil-climate index, produced in collaboration with Stanford University and the University of Calgary. The spread between the carbon emissions from the worst and the best kinds of crude is large. And the researchers say the spread will likely be larger when more types of crude oil are added to the index, since the 30 oils tested represent only about 5 percent of global production. The transportation sector – more than 90 percent of which is fueled with petroleum – makes up more than a quarter of US greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.	1
"This is especially true for plants and animals that live in patchy, geographically small protected areas. Habitats are fragmented, often with no ""corridors"" connecting them to allow for easy migration. Plants and animals in mountain regions, on the other hand, appear to face a lower risk of being overtaken by global warming, because mountains exhibit large temperature swings with altitude. The exception: organisms that live on mountain summits and have nowhere else to go. The work Dr. Loarie and his colleagues have done is adding a new tool to conservationists' quiver, says the University of Maryland's David Inouye, who heads the graduate program in sustainable development and conservation biology there."	2
"Let us learn from that. Let us bring it to the fore and figure out how we are going to take that to scale in a timely fashion to that we can actually bridge that gap,"" Ms. Fugueres said. In the energy sector, responsible for two-thirds of the greenhouse-gas emissions globally, major emitters are making progress. In the US, for instance, greenhouse-gas emissions for each kilowatt-hour of electricity produced has fallen since 2003 to mid-1990s levels, a decline driven by economic downturn but also by the increased availability of relatively inexpensive natural gas extracted from once-marginal reservoirs by fracturing, or ""fracking."" Natural gas releases about half the CO2 that coal does for each megawatt-hour of electricity produced, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency."	1
Even if an intelligent species didn’t rely on combustion early in its development, sustainability issues could still arise. All forms of intensive energy-harvesting will have feedbacks, even if some are more powerful than others. Extracting energy from wind power on a huge scale can cause its own global climate consequences. When it comes to building world-girdling civilizations, there are no planetary free lunches. This realization motivated me, along with Woodruff Sullivan of the University of Washington, to look at sustainability in its astrobiological context.	0
"One longtime mountain climber, Al Read, said he's noticed that summers are warmer than when he started climbing in the Tetons in the 1950s. ""It just seems — I don't have any records of this or anything — but it just seems it was much cooler then."" Some people don't believe in global warming or whatever, but I certainly do."	0
In the long term, bureau employees and outside experts said, the agency will need to invest in new infrastructure that can efficiently capture, conserve and store water without relying on the springtime melting of Sierra Nevada snow. Although Western farmers are among the most politically conservative groups in the country, many of them acknowledge the changing climate and say they want the bureau to make the changes necessary to support them. Over the coming century, the impact of human-caused global warming will diminish the once-thick snowpack across the Sierra Nevada and other Western ranges. “We have enough guys noticing that things are changing, and most of these models suggest we’re going to have more intense weather,” said Dan Keppen, the executive director of the Family Farm Alliance in Klamath Falls, Ore. “The snowpack is going to run off quicker and heavier in the spring, and there will be drier growing seasons.” An interactive map shows how much water California residents conserved in April and how much daily consumption they are being forced to cut under new mandatory restrictions. “So it’s going to be critical to change the water infrastructure,” he said.	0
The exact timing is open to question, he said, but “the idea that most of it would melt, I believe, is a robust result.” Scientists focus on melting ice in part because the consequences are relatively easy to visualize. But if anything like the scenario in the paper were to play out in the real world, the problems would go far beyond a rise of the sea and a retreat from the coasts. Burning all fossil fuels might raise the average temperature of the planet by something like 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Past research suggests that an increase that enormous would likely render vast stretches of the earth too hot and humid for human habitation, cause food production to collapse, and drive much of the plant and animal life of the planet to extinction. In interviews, scientists said that such long-term risks raise profound moral questions for people of today.	1
Describing the Obama-era regulation as the “so-called Clean Power Plan,” the E.P.A. statement said that repealing the measure “will also facilitate the development of U.S. energy resources and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens associated with the development of those resources.” The repeal proposal, which will be filed in the Federal Register on Tuesday, fulfills a promise President Trump made to eradicate his predecessor’s environmental legacy. The United States can fulfill its promise as part of the Paris climate agreement to ratchet down emissions that are warming the planet and contributing to heat waves and sea-level rise. Mr. Trump has vowed to abandon that international accord. It also is a personal triumph for Mr. Pruitt, who as Oklahoma attorney general helped lead more than two dozen states in challenging the rule in the courts.	0
Using 1999 or 2000 as a starting year would yield a more upward-pointing curve. Hungary worried the report would provide ammunition for skeptics. The rise in global average temperatures stopped in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, Arctic sea ice melted to a record low last year and the IPCC draft said sea levels have risen by 7.5 inches (19 centimeters) since 1901. Many researchers say the slowdown in warming is related to the natural ocean cycles of El Nino and La Nina.	2
A United Nations panel has said that the rise of the sea would not likely exceed three feet in that period, and would probably be less. While some island nations may be wiped out by a rise of that magnitude, experts believe most major cities could be protected from it, though at a likely cost in the trillions of dollars. It simply takes longer than a century for large-scale melting to begin. But from that point, the paper found, about half the Antarctic ice sheet would melt or fall into the sea in the first thousand years. “I didn’t expect it would go so fast,” Dr. Caldeira said.	2
Climate scientists are giving science a bad name, says a leading atmospheric physicist in an essay on the global warming debate. Many climate scientists are much less sure about man-made global warming than they will admit in public. But rather than reach out to skeptics in order to open up the debate and explore the uncertainties, they have instead closed ranks and rubbished anyone who disagrees with them: Some of the more vocal of the establishment climate researchers have fallen into a mode of open denigration of climate sceptics (“deniers” is the offensive popular terminology of the day). They insist that only researchers directly within the climate-change community are capable of giving authoritative advice.	1
"RECOMMENDED: Are you scientifically literate? Take the quiz. Fossil fuels are the primary source of about 375 billion tonnes of carbon that has been released into the atmosphere since the industrial era began in 1750. WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said the billions of tonnes of extra carbon dioxide would stay in the atmosphere for centuries, causing the planet to warm further. ""We have already seen that the oceans are becoming more acidic as a result of the carbon dioxide uptake, with potential repercussions for the underwater food chain and coral reefs,"" he said in a statement."	1
"The heaviest losses appeared from the Beaufort Sea above Canada and Alaska west to the East Siberian Sea. A team led by the University of Washington's Jinlun Zhang, a researcher with the university's Applied Physics Laboratory, analyzed the storm's impact via modeling studies. The ice underwent an ""unprecedented"" loss of volume of 12.9 percent. The mechanism? Wind from the storm essentially turned already-thin pack ice into a giant Mix Master as it blew across the pack's rough surface."	1
Data are more sparse for oceans, the researchers acknowledge, which remain a frontier for studying ecological tipping points. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Global warming alone is projected to affect roughly 30 percent of the Earth in ways that would require species to migrate at rates higher than those inferred from the fossil record as they spread during the end of the last ice age. Meanwhile, from interstate highways to urban sprawl, humans have erected more barriers to that migration. The researchers call for beefed up efforts to monitor changes and develop ecological-forecasting tools that could help society anticipate what otherwise might be ecological surprises stemming from human-driven changes to the biosphere.	0
"Compact, well-connected cities are beneficial from a job-growth and productivity perspective, Bapna notes, in addition to climate, quality of life, and sustainability vantage points. One element the report doesn't appear to address is the apparent mismatch between its envisioned planning horizon for investments – the next 15 years – and the IPCC's estimate that to achieve the 2-degree goal, emissions have to peak by 2020 and decline thereafter. Policies, technologies, and incentives such as a global price on carbon are in place now, with the world in effect hitting the ground running today. ""We take on a 15-year time frame because we feel that a 30-year time frame becomes less meaningful from a planning perspective. And something much shorter doesn't give enough time to model the type of transition we need to seek,"" Bapna says."	1
Only about half of the 103 ski resorts in the Northeast will be able to maintain an economically viable ski season by midcentury, another study found in 2012. In Europe, the cradle of ski culture, the problem is even worse. Half the glacial ice in the Alps has already melted. For the American ski industry, the impact has already been pronounced. Between 2001 and 2016, low-snow years cost the industry more than $1 billion and 17,400 jobs compared with an average season, according to a study commissioned by the nonprofit group Protect Our Winters.	1
"It might sound like an unglamorous world of dirt, darkness and daunting pressure but, according to new research from the DCO, harsh conditions haven&apost stopped millions of undiscovered species of microbial life from evolving there since the planet&aposs birth. [Extreme Life on Earth: 8 Bizarre Creatures] In a statement that dubs Earth&aposs deep biosphere a ""subterranean Galapagos"" waiting to be studied, DCO scientists estimate that the sheer biomass of carbon-based life lurking below our feet utterly dwarfs the amount of life roaming the Earth&aposs surface. There is nearly 300 to 400 times as much carbon biomass underground (most of it still undiscovered) as there is in all the humans on Earth. ""Even in dark and energetically challenging conditions, intraterrestrial ecosystems have uniquely evolved and persisted over millions of years,"" Fumio Inagaki, a geomicrobiologist at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and DCO member, said in the statement. ""Expanding our knowledge of deep life will inspire new insights into planetary habitability, leading us to understand why life emerged on our planet and whether life persists in the Martian subsurface and other celestial bodies."""	1
On Friday, Chief Justice John Roberts issued an order on behalf of the Supreme Court to stay the proceedings pending the young plaintiffs’ response to the government’s request to narrow the case. The plaintiffs filed their 103-page response Monday morning, which means the Court has a tight window to decide whether to let the trial begin, as previously scheduled, on October 29. The US government has known for decades that carbon dioxide emissions are endangering the planet. By allowing the production of fossil fuels to continue, the lawsuit alleges, the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to life, liberty, and property is being violated, in addition to their public trust rights. The government asked the Supreme Court over the summer to block the case, citing its “groundless and improper” request to have the Executive Branch devise a “national remedial plan” to phase out carbon dioxide emissions.	0
At least for a substantial portion of the public, it seems like the answer is no. The Pew Research Center, for instance, found that 33 percent of the public believes “Humans and other living things have existed in their present form since the beginning of time” and 26 percent think there is not “solid evidence that the average temperature on Earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades.” Unsurprisingly, beliefs on both topics are divided along religious and partisan lines. There is not solid evidence of global warming. As a result of surveys like these, scientists and advocates have concluded that many people are not aware of the evidence on these issues and need to be provided with correct information. That’s the impulse behind efforts like the campaign to publicize the fact that 97 percent of climate scientists believe human activities are causing global warming.	2
Yet uncertainty surrounds just how much of the gas is billowing now from China’s power plants, boilers, motor vehicles and industrial plants. The scientists behind the new study said they analyzed more detailed information about China’s coal quality, combustion performance across industries and total energy consumption than had previously been used. We measured thousands of samples of coal from mines across China, and found that the carbon content of the coal being burned in China is actually much lower than what has been assumed in previous estimates of emissions. Estimating a country’s carbon dioxide emissions entails some scientific detective work. Researchers start with information about fossil fuel consumption, and then assess how much carbon is contained in those fuels and what fraction of that carbon is actually combusted and ends up in the atmosphere.	1
This is because the darker open ocean absorbs more heat than reflective ice. “And so we see a very persistent, hot spot there in terms of temperature differences from what they should be.” Research suggests that the hot spot, along with changes in the jet stream driven by climate change, cause the polar vortex to break down in mid- to late winter. As the Arctic gets warmer and warmer, the severe weather picks up. In October, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a milder than average winter, but that is not necessarily at odds with the January chill. “There’s a difference between some seasonal outlooks such as NOAA’s that look at the whole three-month period and others that may be breaking it down month by month,” said Bob Henson, a meteorologist with the forecasting service Weather Underground.	0
"GIANT &apos;DELAWARE-SIZE&apos; ICEBERG SET TO BREAK OFF ANTARCTICA Experts also fear the iceberg will melt at a rapid rate. ""If Larsen C now starts to retreat significantly and eventually collapses, then we will see another contribution to sea level rise,"" said Professor David Vaughan, glaciologist and Director of Science at British Antarctic Survey, in a statement. There is little doubt that climate change is causing ice shelves to disappear in some parts of Antarctica at the moment. SPACE BREAKTHROUGH: SCIENTISTS TELEPORT PHOTON FROM EARTH TO ORBIT The professor said though some parts of Antarctica are losing ice due to ocean change, significant warming in the last several decades have contributed to ice shelves collapsing. The new iceberg now poses as a risk for ships passing through the peninsula, according to Reuters."	0
"But if the decline continues, the duo suggests it could signal a tipping point for one of the two major ""sinks"" for the long-buried carbon humans have added to the system by burning coal, oil, and gas, as well as through land-use changes. The other major sink is the ocean, and it appears to be growing less cooperative as well. The fraction of CO2 emissions from human activity appears to have declined by about 5 percent between 1959 and 2008, essentially as the sinks themselves respond to global warming. That response appears to be driving the decline the new study records, Running says. Running and Dr. Zhao used data from NASA's 10-year-old Terra satellite, which monitors changes in vegetation, among other tasks."	2
"Mr. Boucher and Mr. Stoddard are not native Americans. They say they help finance projects that benefit indigenous people. Carbon offsets do more harm than help for native peoples. He says indigenous people from Canada to South America are being pushed off land for incoming carbon projects, and often do not share in the economic benefits created by these offset projects. They are ""just another mechanism to relieve society of the fact that we need to make real changes,"" Mr. Goldtooth says."	2
Worldwide levels of the chief greenhouse gas that causes global warming have hit a milestone, reaching an amount never before encountered by humans. Carbon dioxide was measured at 400 parts per million at the oldest monitoring station in Hawaii which sets the global benchmark. The last time the worldwide carbon level was probably that high was about 2 million years ago, said Pieter Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.	0
The trend will likely continue because of global warming. Janet Gardner, an Australian National University biologist, led a team of scientists who measured museum specimens to plot the decline in size of eight species of Australian birds over the past century. The research, published last week in the British journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, found that the birds in Australia's southeast had become between 2 percent to 4 percent smaller.	0
"But craggers themselves say their action is an important demonstration of public will. Scientists are calling for an 80-percent cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 to stop the world from overheating, but many governments are lagging behind the curve, fearful that the public is not ready for austerity measures. People would never accept carbon rationing. ""If people are doing it voluntarily, then it really puts the government on the defensive,"" Mr. Monbiot adds. CRAGs also provide a forum for members to swap tips about carbon-reduction measures."	1
The North and South Poles always wander a bit, but the movements have increased, and scientists theorize that the redistribution of mass on Earth as glaciers and ice sheets melt is one of the major reasons. We have caused the Earth to wobble, and it’s getting worse. Ice at both ends of the Earth is melting far faster, and oceans are warming far faster, than previously thought, suggesting that scientific estimates of a warming planet have been too conservative. Those are the headlines that should be causing real concern. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.	0
In such circumstances it is virtually impossible to avoid sub-conscious cherrypicking of data to suit the popular theory of the time. Even Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein were not immune from the problem. It is nonetheless the case that once freed of the burden of having to earn a living or retain their tenure in an academe in thrall to the man-made global warming narrative. It seems that scientists too are conscious of the need to eat, and like everyone else must consider the consequences of public dissent from the views of the powers-that-be. One example was Dr Brian Tucker.	2
Paul Homewood has now exposed his three falsest claims for the #fakenews they are: 1) The rate of global sea-level rise has accelerated and is now four times faster than it was 100 years ago According to Jevrejeva’s study in 2014, based on 1277 tidal gauges: The new reconstruction suggests a linear trend of 1.9 ± 0.3 mm·yr− 1 during the 20th century, with 1.8 ± 0.5 mm·yr− 1 since 1970. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818113002750?via%3Dihub And this is their graph of global sea levels: Jevrejevaetal2013GPChange It is plainly evident that sea levels have been steadily rising since the mid 19thC, with a slight slow down between 1970 and 1990. The IPCC acknowledged the same thing in their AR5 Report in 2013. and 2) We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage Again, this is a fake claim. According to a NASA study in 2015, the land ice is actually growing in Antarctica. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice. According to the new analysis of satellite data, the Antarctic ice sheet showed a net gain of 112 billion tons of ice a year from 1992 to 2001.	1
The United States has been showing the way. Hydraulic fracturing has produced an abundance of inexpensive natural gas, leading to a shift away from coal in electricity production. The United States reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the lowest level since the mid-1990s, even as emissions rise globally. We need to export this technology and help other nations exploit it. At the same time, wealthy Western nations must step up investments into research and development in green energy technologies to ensure that cleaner energy eventually becomes so cheap that everyone will want it.	1
In 2012, all the Republican presidential candidates but one — Jon M. Huntsman Jr. — questioned or denied the science that determined that humans caused global warming, and opposed policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But over the past year, President Obama has proposed a series of Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, which Republicans in Congress have attacked as a “war on coal.” But those positions appear to be out of step with the majority of the electorate. If nothing is done to reduce emissions, global warming will be a very or somewhat serious problem in the future. But substantial differences remain between the two parties on the issue. Democrats are much more likely than Republicans or independents to say that the issue of global warming is important to them.	0
“It’s kind of like telling a little girl who’s trying to run across a busy street to catch a school bus to go for it, knowing there’s a substantial chance that she’ll be killed,” said Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “She might make it. Reining in carbon emissions is both futile and unnecessary, and that money is better spent adapting to what he says will be moderately higher temperatures. Among other initiatives, he said, the authorities could limit development in coastal and hurricane-prone areas, expand flood plains, make manufactured housing more resistant to tornadoes and high winds, and make farms in arid regions less dependent on imported water — or move production to rainier places. Dr. Christy’s scenario is not completely out of the realm of possibility, his critics say, but it is highly unlikely.	2
To the Editor: “Fixing Climate Change May Add No Costs, Report Says” (news article, Sept. 16) brings us good news on the practicality of moving to cleaner energy sources, but there is more: The article does not mention the enormous costs that climate change has already begun levying on all of us in the form of damage from extreme weather. The cleanup costs after storms like Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina are in the tens of billions. Extreme storms will be much more frequent as a result of global warming. The damage becomes that much worse as sea level rises. Warming temperatures have also multiplied the acreage destroyed by wildfires in the Western United States many times over.	0
“We’re focusing on the trade impact,” said Mr. Lin, a professor in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at Peking University’s School of Physics. “Trade changes the location of production and thus affects emissions.” Powerful global winds called westerlies can carry pollutants from China across the Pacific within days, leading to “dangerous spikes in contaminants,” especially during the spring, according to a news release from the University of California, Irvine, where one of the study’s co-authors, Steven J. Davis, is an earth system scientist. Dust, ozone and carbon can accumulate in valleys and basins in California and other Western states. Black carbon is a particular problem because rain does not wash it out of the atmosphere, so it persists across long distances, the statement said. Black carbon is linked to asthma, cancer, emphysema, and heart and lung disease.	1
"Both of these satellites use radar techniques to gauge ice-shelf thickness and dynamics. The team used the data to investigate the flow of the Dotson ice shelf, a 30-mile-wide (50 kilometers) expanse off the remote coast of Marie Byrd Land. Melting is not uniform. This under-ice canyon is probably formed by relatively warm ocean water — 33.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius — that circulates clockwise and upward due to the planet&aposs rotation, Gourmelen said. ""Revisiting older satellite data, we think that this melt pattern has been taking place for at least the entire 25 years that Earth observation satellites have been recording changes in Antarctica,"" he said."	1
(NOAA considers December-February as meteorological winter.) All of which heightens the debate over climate change – which 97 percent of climate scientists (according to NASA) say has been dramatically influenced by human activities. A comprehensive and long-range plan to tackle global warming has yet to be passed. Consequently, President Obama has issued some executive orders dealing with the root causes of climate change. On Thursday, Obama signed an order requiring the federal government to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2025 from 2008 levels while increasing the amount of renewable energy supplying electricity to federal facilities to 30 percent over the same period.	1
"""Cool sea surface temperatures around Antarctica could offset projected snowfall increases in Antarctica, with implications for estimates of future sea-level rise,"" it said. The U.N. panel of climate scientists has estimated that sea levels will rise by between 18 and 59 cm (7-24 inches) this century, more if thaws of Antarctica and Greenland accelerate. Antarctica alone will make sea levels fall by between 2 and 14 cms this century because more snowfall will extract water from the sea. But Sunday's study said that Antarctica was losing about 250 billion tonnes of ice a year - equivalent to 0.07 millimetre (0.003 inch) of sea level rise a year, Bintanja said. ""Antarctic mass loss seems to be accelerating,"" it said."	0
“This is no different from the smoking issue,” Schwarzenegger said. “The tobacco industry knew for years and years and years and decades, that smoking would kill people, would harm people and create cancer, and were hiding that fact from the people and denied it. Every gas station on it, every car should have a warning label on it, every product that has fossil fuels should have a warning label on it. Suggesting that the question of whether humans are causing global warming is settled — and, according to Schwarzenegger, has been settled for decades — is irresponsible. Many scientists from countries across the world are skeptical of the claim humans are to blame for global warming.	0
Global emissions of carbon dioxide are slowing somewhat from the rapid pace of the last decade. Scientists compiling the numbers said it was unclear whether the slowdown in the growth of emissions might represent the beginnings of a permanent shift. One-time factors in China, including the opening of several large new dams to supply electricity, played a substantial role, as did slower economic growth there.	1
"That's 172 percent higher than the average 2.9 percent returns on all US stocks and 68 percent greater than the average 4.7 percent returns on all college and university endowment assets. Those numbers don't tell the whole story, divestment activists counter. The threat of future regulations, geopolitical instability, and overestimated reserves make fossil fuels financially risky. ""In a very realistic, investment-centric view, one should be concerned about owning fossil fuels,"" says Mr. Streur of Portfolio 21. After hearing Mr. McKibben speak in Washington last fall, Krista Kurth and her husband took a hard look at where their own money was going."	1
While the effects are strongest in the tropics, they appear at higher latitudes as well. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Natural climate swings are playing a greater role in the loss of ice from West Antarctica than global warming. If conditions are largely governed by conditions in the tropical Pacific, as they appear to be, an ability to project the ice sheet's future in a warmer world depends on researcher's ability to figure out whether El Niño conditions will predominate in the future, or La Niña conditions – El Niño's opposite. This study also was published Sunday in Nature Geoscience.	2
“We probably wouldn’t be seeing the scale of some of these fires if it weren’t for those factors.” The weather pattern known as El Niño has been pumping a huge amount of heat from the ocean and into the atmosphere for more than a year, and scientists say that could also have played a role in setting the conditions for this year’s fires. Temperatures in parts of Alberta were as much as 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the weeks before the fires began, desiccating the landscape. The overall increase in fire in northern regions would not be happening without global warming. The rising danger was predicted decades ago, as one of the likely consequences of human emissions. One of the scientists who published such a forecast in the 1990s, Brian J.	0
Mr. McConnell has told state governors not to bother complying with the plan, and Republicans are challenging it in court. “The Obama administration’s pledge to the United Nations today will not see the light of day with the 114th Congress,” Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (R) of Oklahoma said in a statement Tuesday. China to continue to expand its energy infrastructure and increase emissions through 2030 while American taxpayers and businesses foot the bill of his extremist global warming agenda. Many of the actions being taken by Obama to meet the US’s commitment will be “difficult to undo because they’re under existing laws,” Mr. Deese said. In short, the President may not need new authority from a GOP congress to meet its pledge.	2
The deliberations over climate change, however, have long been marked by disputes over which nations should bear major responsibility for limiting greenhouse gas emissions. China, India and other developing Asian economies have resisted American urging to commit to reductions in their own carbon emissions, arguing that the United States, the world’s largest economy, should shoulder most of the economic burden. Action by the United States alone will not slow global warming significantly unless other large economies commit to carbon cuts, as well. China recently surpassed the United States as the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and emissions across Asia are projected to surge in the coming decades as millions more people in the developing economies there begin to drive automobiles and gain access to electric power. Indonesia is in third place, after China and the United States.	1
“I think there will be a political problem for the Republican Party going into 2016 if we don’t define what we are for on the environment,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R) of South Carolina, who has worked on climate legislation with Democrats, told Roll Call in November. “I don’t know what the environmental policy of the Republican Party is.” Though he voted for an amendment in January stating climate change is real, Mr. Cruz has repeatedly questioned the role humans play in it. Global warming is not supported by data, despite scientific consensus to the contrary. And though questioning climate science polls poorly with the general electorate – only 27 percent were more likely to vote for a candidate staking such a position – the New York Times poll found 49 percent of Tea Party voters were more likely to pick a candidate who avoids taking a stand on climate change. In other words: “It recruits more Tea Partyers than it repels,” Jon Krosnick, a professor of political science at Stanford University and author of the survey, told the New York Times.	2
The organization is working to get the nation’s 100 biggest cities to commit to making a 10-minute walk to a park a reality for all residents. So far, 55 have made that pledge or promised better. Parks help cities become more resilient and sustainable as communities and governments try to lighten their carbon footprints and prepare for climate change. Many of the cities with the 10 highest scores seem like no-brainers, given their world-famous parks systems or culture of environmental awareness — Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Portland, Ore., New York City and Boston are all in the top 10. But there’s also Irvine, Calif., one of the country’s largest planned cities, which made room early on for r many community and neighborhood parks.	0
“The Air Resources Board’s approval of its plan to implement the Global Warming Solutions Act will reinforce this trend. Our state is well-positioned to make enacting this law an opportunity, both economically and environmentally, rather than a burden, as some naysayers suggest. The most expensive option for California is inaction in fighting global warming.	0
The problem is not limited to the United States. The report estimates that a third of all the food produced in the world is never consumed, and the total cost of that food waste could be as high as $400 billion a year. Reducing food waste from 20 to 50 percent globally could save $120 billion to $300 billion a year by 2030. “Food waste is a global issue, and tackling it is a priority,” said Richard Swannell, director of sustainable food systems at the Waste and Resources Action Program, or Wrap, an antiwaste organization in Britain that compiled the new report. “The difficulty is often in knowing where to start and how to make the biggest economic and environmental savings.” The food discarded by retailers and consumers in the most developed countries would be more than enough to feed all of the world’s 870 million hungry people, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.	1
“A lot of it’s a hoax, it’s a hoax,” said Mr. Trump, then a Republican primary candidate. “I mean, it’s a moneymaking industry, O.K.? The global fight against climate change is a threat to the American economy. In his speech withdrawing from the Paris accord, the president said the agreement imposes “draconian financial and economic burdens” that are “unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.” Mr. Trump could quietly publish the special report this year and the broader assessment when the final version is due in 2018. He could also make the case that the findings should be tempered by the economic effects that fighting climate change could have on American workers and businesses.	1
"“When we first started seeing high concentrations of helium-3, we thought we had a cluster of bad or suspicious data.” Loose said the presence of helium-3 is a ""fingerprint for volcanism,"" noting it&apos;s relatively abundant in the seawater at the Pine Island shelf. University of East Anglia Professor Karen Heywood, who also worked on the study, said the presence of volcanoes just means there&apos;s an additional source of heat to melt the ice. It will be important to include this in our efforts to estimate whether the Antarctic ice sheet might become unstable and further increase sea level rise. Last year, significant parts of the Pine Island Glacier separated from the main shelf. In February 2017, a piece of the glacier approximately 1 mile wide separated."	1
"Richards argued that ""so much publicly funded climate research has not hewed closely enough to the data itself, preferring instead to rely on speculative models based on poorly tested assumptions."" Rather than determining ""facts on the ground"" in order to enable policymakers to ""run cost/benefit analyses based on the real world,"" the EPA ""models assume the question ahead of time, so don't constitute independent evidence of it."" With respect to climate change, it has yet to be determined precisely what the role of human activity is, and in particular, how sensitive the climate is to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. ""What is fairly clear is that most of the models predict about twice the rate of warming as we actually observe. That is the central scandal of the climate change debate."""	2
Investment fell in Spain, France, Italy and Germany in 2013, and only Britain managed to come close to matching 2012 investment levels in 2013. Worldwide, clean-energy investment fell 12 percent last year. Europe become a global leader in reducing greenhouse gases. It is already nearing its target of reducing 1990-level greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. The European Commission is likely now to propose reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 35 percent to 40 percent by 2030, and increasing the share of renewable energy to up to 27 percent.	1
If you were seriously thinking about running for president of the United States, wouldn’t this be something you’d want to have studied up on? Have you ever heard anybody say he couldn’t comment on tax policy because he wasn’t an accountant? The scientists are wrong when they say global warming is real. They act like people who don’t want to have to face up to the facts and come up with solutions. Which would involve making the coal and oil companies super unhappy.	2
"The Monroe County commissioner recently toured the islands from Key Largo to Key West, highlighting areas of concern in a report afterward. He is also part of a task force that three Florida counties have formed to tackle sea-rise and global-warming issues. Action is needed now to counter effects from a further rise in sea level. ""There are those who take a position that it's not happening at all. As elected officials, we don't have that luxury,"" he says."	0
“The fight against climate change and all the research, innovation and technological progress it will bring will continue with or without the United States.” Though Mr. Li and European leaders in Brussels failed, because of a trade policy dispute, to endorse a joint statement on climate change, on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry expressed support for the Paris Agreement. “China is willing to enhance cooperation with all sides to together advance the follow-up negotiations on details of implementing the Paris Agreement and also advance its effective implementation,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said at a regular briefing in Beijing. Climate change is a global problem, and requires that the international community cooperate in its response. Fiji, among the island nations most threatened by rising sea levels, is to be the focus of the next international conference on climate change, in November in Bonn, Germany. The chancellor said that Fiji could count on Germany and France for support.	0
“That’s completely understandable, but it also means they have no hope of preparing themselves.” Dr. Rahman said that he did not disagree with Dr. Pethick’s findings, but that no estimate was definitive. Other scientists have predicted more modest rises. Seas in the region could rise five to six feet by 2100. “There is no doubt that preparations within Bangladesh have been utterly inadequate, but any such preparations are bound to fail because the problem is far too big for any single government,” said Tariq A. Karim, Bangladesh’s ambassador to India. “We need a regional and, better yet, a global solution.	0
“Maybe a carbon tax can be the tax that we employ to deal with our revenue shortfall and climate change at the same time,” he says. A solid majority of Alaskans, 63 percent, said they support taxing fossil fuel companies while equally reducing other taxes, according to data released this week from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Alaskans have something of an appetite for a carbon tax. Rose is also buoyed by the fact that the state’s residents are used to the idea of paying for pollution. Alaskans have to take either their own garbage to the landfill or pay out of pocket for a company pick it up.	1
Annual global temperatures always rise and fall on either side of the longer-term average, in much the same way that the stocks rise and fall from day to day, even during a strong market. They believe, based on computer simulations of hiatus periods and measurements from new floating sensors, they can account for the “missing” heat, much of which they believe is deep in the ocean, more than 700 meters below the water’s surface. Climate-change skeptics earn mainstream adherents last year, as global temperatures hung perilously close to falling beneath even the lowest model projections. “Apocalypse perhaps a little later,” as The Economist put it. There is some evidence that the number of Americans who don’t believe in global warming has increased by about 7 percentage points since the pause or hiatus began to gain mainstream news media attention, according to polling data provided by Edward Maibach, the director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University.	2
It was concern about the consequences of that warming that drew people to the march, organized by a dozen environmental, labor and social justice groups, and that inspired some of the event’s most sober and most outrageous expressions, some of them not even on the route. In front of the Flatiron Building, on Fifth Avenue, a 3,000-pound ice sculpture spelled out “The Future.” Dripping onto the sidewalk, it had been carved over two days in Queens by a group of Japanese ice sculptors. We are melting down the future. “It’s a comment on what we are doing to the planet.” At Columbus Circle, there were bare-breasted women and people with dreadlocks and homespun clothing. There were Muslim women wearing hijabs and groups of older women with signs proclaiming they were “Grandmas Against Global Warming.” and that “Gray Is Green.” Two high school seniors from Long Island, Kirsten Cunha and Alexandra Dos Santos, both 17, marched with dust masks over their mouths.	0
But with California’s growing population, the state faces increasing pressure to resolve tensions involved in apportioning its water among city dwellers, farmers, industry and an environment under increasing strain from global warming. Dr. Seager of Columbia University pointed out that much of the Southwestern United States had been in a drought of fluctuating severity for 15 years. Winter precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow, meaning less melting snowpack to help parched states through the hotter summers. “It all adds up across the Southwest to an increasingly stressed water system,” he said. “That’s what they might as well get ready for.”	0
A handful of studies show some positive effects from climate change on agriculture at high latitudes, but the panel notes that additional work needs to be done to determine if the impact overall is positive or not. Generally, however, negative effects on crops are more common than positive effects. Changes in rain and snowfall patterns and melting glaciers are reducing water availability and quality in many regions. Affects on human health to this point are harder to quantify, according to the panel. Global warming's contribution to ill health is tiny compared with non-climate factors.	0
A draft version of the paper was released last year, and it provoked a roiling debate among climate scientists. The main conclusions have not changed, and that debate seems likely to be replayed in the coming weeks. By burning fossil fuels at a prodigious pace and pouring heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, humanity is about to provoke an abrupt climate shift. Specifically, the authors believe that fresh water pouring into the oceans from melting land ice will set off a feedback loop that will cause parts of the great ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to disintegrate rapidly. The issue can be overwhelming.	0
Like most other scientists, she frankly wasn’t very good at it, having been drilled on precision, data, and careful interpretation. Public communication, however, required charisma, power, and clear translation. Throughout her career, the global lack of action to slow climate change had become an increasingly alarming issue. She began to pounce on every course, conference, and any other opportunity to practice speaking publicly about science. “Our respective discipline areas are so narrow and specific that when we talk as scientists, there’s only a small group of people that can really understand that language,” Myhre says.	0
May you know it! May you know it!” While sea levels may not have been rising then, as they are now, changes in the water temperature may have been to blame for making life virtually unlivable in parts of the region. The surface temperatures of the Mediterranean Sea cooled rapidly during this time, severely reducing precipitation over the coasts. The study concluded that agriculture would have suffered and that the conditions might have influenced the “population declines, urban abandonments and long-distance migrations associated with the period.” To top it off, catastrophic events, in the form of a series of earthquakes, also rocked many ancient cities in these areas from around 1225 to 1175 B.C. These, together with the famines and droughts, would have further undermined the societies of the time, most likely leading to internal rebellions by the underclass and peasant populations who were facing severe food shortages, as well as invasions by migrating peoples.	1
These proposals have been portrayed incorrectly, says Chris Paolino, a spokesman for the Interior Department. The proposed changes to the ESA, Mr. Paolino says, would clarify the Interior secretary’s belief that the ESA is not the right mechanism for regulating climate change. Science at this point cannot make the link between the specific greenhouse-gas emissions from, say, Kansas, and link it to the effect on a subset of polar bears or an individual polar bear in the Arctic region. As for the reduced number of federal scientific reviews of projects, he believes it will allow the Fish & Wildlife scientists to give more time to projects that are more likely to affect listed species. Environmental groups counter that allowing different agencies to determine whether a project needs independent scientific review hasn’t worked in the past and could lead to a scattershot approach in which potential hazards to species are overlooked.	2
Continued global warming poses a risk of rapid, drastic changes in some human and natural systems. At the same time, some worst-case fears about climate change that have entered the popular imagination can be ruled out as unlikely, at least over the next century, the panel found. These include a sudden belch of methane from the ocean or the Arctic that would fry the planet, as well as a shutdown of the heat circulation in the Atlantic Ocean that would chill nearby land areas — the fear on which the 2004 movie “The Day After Tomorrow” was loosely based.	0
"""There is a huge climate industrial complex benefitting from this, but it's not reducing emissions,"" he said. Even ""if the United States reduced its emissions to zero, it would have no impact on global warming, because Chinese emissions have gone up so rapidly."" The U.S. going back to the stone age will not do anything to stop global warming. As for global warming, the false impression of a crisis is ""driven by alarmists who use scary computer model predictions, which have been completely falsified by the actual temperature data."" Ebell claimed that the current rate of warming is ""about one-half to one-third of what the United Nations average of computer models has predicted."""	1
Another lesson is that the mainstream media simply cannot be trusted to apply any kind of professional scrutiny to alarmist papers. No environmental correspondent, it’s true, would have had the advanced math skills that Nic Lewis used to find the paper false. There is not one science or environment correspondent attached to any mainstream media publication prepared to do their due diligence on global warming scare stories. They are all so wedded to the alarmist consensus that they scarcely even bother to alter the press release. Finally, do not expect this humiliating retraction to be given anywhere near the prominence afforded the original story.	2
Indian officials have demanded that the Paris deal lock in language that the money would come from public funds — a dealbreaker for rich countries. This summer, Mr. Gates pledged to spend $1 billion of his personal fortune on researching and deploying clean energy technology, but the people with knowledge of his plans said the new fund would include larger commitments. If we create the right environment for innovation, we can accelerate the pace of progress, develop and deploy new solutions, and eventually provide everyone with reliable, affordable energy that is carbon free. We can avoid the worst climate-change scenarios while also lifting people out of poverty, growing food more efficiently and saving lives by reducing pollution.” Mr. Gates met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. In a June meeting in Paris, Mr. Gates told President François Hollande of France that the Paris deal should include robust provisions on clean energy research and development.	1
This week, the Berkeley City Council issued a resolution declaring a worldwide climate emergency, calling it “the greatest crisis in history” after evoking memories of World War II. The United States of America has disproportionately contributed to the climate and ecological crises and to preventing a transition away from fossil fuels, and Americans thus bear an extraordinary responsibility to solve the crises. Apparently the six million Jews massacred during the Second World War, not to mention the other tens of millions of casualties, do not measure up to the overarching evils of climate change—at least in the minds of the Berkeley City Council. Droughts, famines, and diseases produced by global warming “have already killed millions of people in the Global South,” the document announces, adding that the earth is “already too hot for safety and justice.” “The global economy’s overshoot of ecological limits and, increasingly climate change, are driving a global fresh water scarcity crisis and the sixth mass extinction of species, which could devastate much of life on earth for the next ten million years,” the resolution warns.	0
The refuge is one of our largest intact ecosystems left on earth, and provisions to drill there simply have no place in an already terrible tax bill. Nevertheless, Republicans have included Arctic drilling in the Senate bill because they know that they don’t have the votes to approve this spectacularly bad idea under regular order. Climate change is upon us and that the last thing we should do is double down on drilling for oil, especially in a national treasure like the Arctic refuge. When the refuge was last under serious attack in 2005, pro-environment Republicans in the House stood together and helped ensure that it remained protected. All Republicans in Congress today who care about the environment should do the same.	0
 In this photo provided by Kim Cobb, shows Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb in November at the remote Pacific island of Kiritimati, finding a bit of hope and life amid what in April was a ghost town of dead coral. (The Associated Press) The oceans are under attack and all signs point toward humans as the perpetrators. Sea temperatures are rising. For most accounts, the future for plants and animals on Earth looks pretty grim. One could argue that rampant advances in technology are what got us here in the first place.	0
But the changes to spring melting already appear to be causing the pre-monsoon river flow to fall just when farmers are planting their crops. Worse, said Wester, the monsoon is also becoming more erratic and prone to extreme downpours. One-in-100 year floods are starting to happen every 50 years. The new report highlights how vulnerable many mountain people are, with one-third living on less than $1.90 a day and far away from help if climate disaster strikes. Political tensions between neighbouring nations such as India and Pakistan could add to the difficulties.	1
Mark S. Dolecki, Baytown, Tex. To slow global warming, it is critical that millions of people change their personal habits and behaviors. The best place to begin is air travel, with its big carbon footprint. Annually the average American produces 19 tons of CO2. So I challenge everyone who flies to dramatically reduce plane travel now.	0
They somehow tend to neglect mentioning that solar variation is smaller than the heat-trapping power of carbon dioxide,” Aaron Huertas of the Union of Concerned Scientists told FoxNews.com. To back that up, Huertas points to data that show that solar activity and temperature rose together from 1880 until 1960, but that then, solar activity stopped increasing -- even as temperatures continued going up. Solar activity has varied a bit while global temperature keeps going up. But Rawls said that while solar activity has indeed stopped increasing, the important thing is that it remains at a historically high level. “The simplest way to put it is: If you put a pot on the stove at the maximum temperature, and leave it on at that temperature -- are you telling me that the pot won’t keep warming?” Rawls worries that if solar activity falls, the effects could be dire.	1
Humans are not to blame for global warming. This will save the Katrinas and Sandys of the world from the injustice of having their names attached to major disaster, the group says. And, as a bonus, it will produce some peculiar weather reports.	2
East Antarctica has been a mysterious place when it comes to climate change. The region has been gaining ice due to increases in snow accumulation, according to 2015 research. Global warming can increase snowfall by boosting the amount of moisture in the air. The Roi Baudouin crater was more mysterious still. It&apos;s existed on satellite images going back to at least 1989, researchers said, but was first noted widely in January 2015.	0
They says its deployment could needlessly delay the process of weaning economies from fossil fuels – the dominant source of global CO2 emissions. In addition, once the carbon dioxide is scrubbed – either at the smokestack or from the air itself – storing it for hundreds to thousands of years to keep it out of the atmosphere brings its own set of environmental concerns. Some form of carbon capture and storage (or recycling) ultimately will be needed to counter global warming. Economies continue to pump CO2 into the atmosphere at a significant pace. Each fresh molecule of CO2 that isn't absorbed by the oceans or by terrestrial plants will remain in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, greasing the skids for additional warming.	0
A few Norwegian radio stations and newspapers reported the incident at the time, but it received little international attention until May, when it was becoming clear that President Trump was likely to pull the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. Suddenly the tidings from Svalbard were everywhere, in multiple languages, with headlines like “World’s ‘Doomsday’ Seed Vault Has Been Breached by Climate Change.” It didn’t matter that the flood happened seven months earlier, or that the seeds remained safe and dry. We had just lived through the third consecutive year of the highest global temperatures on record and the lowest levels of Arctic ice. All these facts felt like signposts to an increasingly hopeless future for the planet. And now, here was a minifable suggesting that our attempts to preserve even mere traces of the bounty around us might fall apart, too.	0
Such ambitions, though, will come at a significant near-term price: At least $1 billion of its capital funding alone will be devoted to enhancing the city-owned buildings over the next decade, the administration said, excluding the cost of the private building alterations and other changes. Though the city’s many competing financial interests mean there are typically few spending guarantees, particularly on projects intended to span decades, officials insist the money will be incorporated in its 10-year capital plan, to be released early next year. Global warming was much more of an abstraction to New York City until two years ago. “There’s a moral imperative to act.” But with a global audience looking toward New York this week, as world leaders including President Obama converge to discuss climate change, Mr. de Blasio is training attention not just on its waterfront but on its skyline: The city — dense and walkable, with an extensive subway system — has long been more environmentally friendly than most. As a result, nearly three-quarters of emissions come from energy used in buildings.	1
“The irony is this,” said Phil West, a spokesman for Spectra Energy, whose pipeline projects, including those in New York State, have come under attack. “The shift to additional natural gas use is a key contributor to helping the U.S. reduce energy-related emissions and improve air quality.” Those who oppose natural gas pipelines say the science is on their side. Methane, the chief component of natural gas, is a powerful greenhouse gas in the short term, with more than 80 times the effect of carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The Obama administration is issuing regulations to reduce leaks, but environmental opposition to fracking, and events like the huge methane plume released at a storage facility in the Porter Ranch neighborhood near Los Angeles, have helped embolden the movement. The issue can be overwhelming.	1
Some scientists say an ice age was prevented thousands of years ago by the dawn of human agriculture – deforestation and farming released enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to prevent another global cool down, the theory goes. New farming techniques will put some of that carbon back into the ground and help stem the rising tide of global warming. No-till agriculture, in which farmers don’t plow their fields anymore, is one practice said to promote carbon sequestration in the soil. Organic farming is another.	0
"What makes earthquakes so terrifying is that there are so few clues available to geologists in their attempts to pin down when a major earthquake could occur. The Christian Science Monitor profiled American geologist Kerry Sieh, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, when he traveled to Aceh to examine exposed sea cliff features along the ocean to observe the layers of sand that past tsunamis have dumped onto the island. The sea level used to be much higher, and that tsunamis over the years have washed more and more sand on the shore, which created natural layers that could give Mr. Sieh a clue towards the frequency of tsunamis over time. In many ways geologists have to work in reverse for this method dubbed ""paleo-geology."" While finding an accurate way to determine an imminent earthquake still eludes scientists, early-warning systems for tracking tsunamis are making a life-saving difference."	1
In the end, they found that the deaths caused by colonization led to a drop of about 3.5 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That finding can be instructive, Ms. Perren said. There are natural ways to address the modern global warming problem. “We’re always searching for these great technologies that will do it on a megascale, but the most efficient way you can pull CO₂ out of the atmosphere is with trees,” she said. Still, the effect that the authors describe pales compared to the toll modern humanity has taken — in the opposite direction.	0
Koch Industries is a privately held corporation with subsidiaries in energy and other industries. Mr. Koch and his family have funded conservative causes, including scientists and organizations that contest the role of humans in climate change. Many fossil-fuel companies have made similar contributions to such organizations and scientists over the years. The letter is a project of the Natural History Museum, a mobile museum that draws attention to “social and political forces that shape nature yet are left out of traditional natural history museums,” said its co-founder and director, Beka Economopoulos. A petition drive, also released on Tuesday and sponsored by environmental organizations including Greenpeace and the Sierra Club, urges the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History to “Kick Koch off the board!” Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University and signer of the letter, said the donors seek a halo they do not deserve.	1
Environmentalists realize that a recession is a cruel remedy for climate change. “No one would argue that a recession is the way to solve our climate problems,” says Manish Bapna, executive vice president and managing director of the World Resources Institute. It puts a little time back on the carbon clock. “But it’s not something you can count on.” “It’s not a blockbuster impact,” adds Frank O’Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch. “You would have to have a screaming downturn and no manufacturing at all to change that [worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions] in a huge, measurable way.” Environmentalists are more encouraged about how efforts to stimulate economies, especially in China and the US, may have “green” effects.	1
"It mentions extreme weather and rising sea levels, such as heat waves, flooding and droughts. It even raises, as an earlier report did, the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food. And ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life. Without changes in greenhouse gas emissions, ""climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century,"" the report says. In 2009, countries across the globe set a goal of limiting global warming to about another 2 degrees Fahrenheit (-16.67 Celsius) above current levels."	0
Concentrations continued to rise even as emissions slipped because even at the reduced pace, humans are pumping CO2 into the atmosphere faster than natural processes can scrub the gas, meaning that human emissions can stay in the atmosphere for centuries, if not longer. “More CO2 is staying in the atmosphere instead of being absorbed by the ocean and land sinks, like trees and other vegetation,” said Richard Feely, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle and a member of the team producing the report. If the natural sinks can't keep pace with the increased CO2 emissions, then the physical and biological impacts of global warming will accelerate over the next century. Many countries have agreed in principle to try to stabilize emissions at 350 parts-per-million by century's end. That would result in a 50 percent chance of holding the increase in global average temperatures to about 2 degrees C over preindustrial levels.	0
"And, contrary to the proclamations of climate activists, every single year more people die from the cold than from the heat."" Furthermore, it is far from ""settled"" that human activity is the main or even a primary source behind climate change. Just how vacuous the global warming narrative has become. In 1988, confident scientists predicted the sinking of the Maldives islands in 30 years. In 2018, the Maldives were still afloat, and actually expanding their landmasses."	2
"While rainfall rates increase whether the long-term warming trend is natural or not, the rate of increase appears to be higher during natural warming trends. The result might help resolve a long-standing discrepancy between changes in rainfall projected in global climate models and changes projected by studying the historical record, researchers say. Carbon dioxide has a fundamentally different mode of warming than natural climate change. While the effect is most pronounced the the Pacific basin, the work ""is about something more fundamental.... Natural and human-caused climate change really produce different effects."" ""It will become increasingly clearer, as time goes on, that the rainfall patterns that we're seeing are not same ones we see in past warm periods,"" he adds."	1
Most atmospheric scientists attribute the climate's current long-term warming trend at least in part to a build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly carbon-dioxide. The buildup of CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels, as well as from land-use changes. These new results will help us answer important questions in terms of both sea-level rise and how the planet's cold regions are responding to global change. Retreating mountain glaciers have become among the most prominent icons of global warming. “The good news here is that they are not losing mass as quickly as we thought,” says Ian Howat, a glacier and ice-sheet specialist at Ohio State University's Byrd Polar Research Center in Columbus, Ohio.	1
Figuring out what to do with debris is one of the most challenging aspects of any storm, and because decisions are generally made at the local level, she said, “every community has to kind of reinvent the wheel.” Setting aside appliances like refrigerators for recycling, chipping downed trees for mulch instead of burning them, prevents pollution and extends the life of landfills. Leaking landfills can pollute groundwater. Separating waste by type is anything but fussy, especially in the age of climate change, when scientists have shown that global warming is producing wetter storms and contributing to more destructive storm surges, and could also be making some storms more powerful. “I fully understand people saying, ‘This is an emergency — let’s suspend the norms,’ ” Ms. Enck said. “But these hurricanes and floods are becoming the norm.” Historically, Texas has not shown deep concern over environmental issues, and in the current crisis, its stance on debris removal has been similar.	0
Climate is a difficult branch of science, full of ambiguities and uncertainties. But scientists can justly claim to have demonstrated some predictive skill about many of the potential implications of the human release of greenhouse gases. Emissions of carbon dioxide would cause the planet to warm. It took more than 80 years to be sure he was right. At roughly the same time that realization was taking hold, climate scientists running computer models of the atmosphere began to focus on the likelihood of heavier rains in a future climate.	0
“We want to make climate change a local issue,” said a spokesman for Nextgen Climate, Bobby Whithorne. The Republican state party chairwoman, Susan Hutchison, said she thought that argument would backfire with voters in a state that already has one of the most environmentally friendly, low-carbon-emission energy profiles in the nation with its reliance on hydropower. Carrying a climate agenda even further, through measures like a carbon tax on gasoline, natural gas and other products, would hurt ordinary Washingtonians. “With Steyer’s very radical environmental agenda, we’ve got the possibility of gas costing a dollar more per gallon,” she said. “It would profoundly hurt our middle-class working families,” she added.	2
The volume is the strongest signal yet of a sea change in thinking during the past decade on adaptation to climate change. Although the IPCC has dealt with the subject all along, adaptation is seen by many activist groups on global warming as a cop-out – a topic aimed at diverting attention from the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Even if countries slammed the brakes on emissions today, the climate would continue to warm because carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries. The gradual-but-relentless build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution is an indication that humans are pumping it into the air faster than natural processes can remove the excess. Increasingly, some degree of adaptation has come to be seen as a necessity, not a diversion.	0
"What I said is that is going to happen unless we take action to help and prevent it."" The full statement during the town hall does indicate that Clinton was trying to make a larger point as she said ""we don't want to forget those people"" who worked in the coal mines for generations. Now we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on. But her answer doesn't seem to be enough for many voters in Kentucky who still have her initial line reverberating in their heads. And her answer — aligned with her policy positions — isn't exactly enough for Paul either."	0
"There are still billions of people who live with no electricity or little electricity,"" he said. ""Most of these people are in very hot climates and don't have air conditioning, like India or Indonesia."" Global warming might become a problem. ""The crisis has been manufactured in order to create a huge climate industrial complex that can command the redistribution of colossal amounts of money."" ""There is a huge climate industrial complex benefitting from this, but it's not reducing emissions,"" he said."	1
If God granted humanity free will, she sometimes asks audiences, why would that not include the capacity to harm the planet? Religious conservatives who oppose environmentalism profess a deep concern for the plight of the poor. Economic success has historically been closely linked to the use of fossil fuels. “The policies meant to mitigate global warming would oppress the poor by depriving them of the energy without which they cannot rise out of poverty,” E. Calvin Beisner, a leader of an American group called the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, declared this year in Rome at a symposium held to pre-emptively counter Francis’ message. Liberal groups often dismiss that view as tendentious, yet it is precisely the fear that preoccupies countries like India that have refused to commit to serious emissions limits.	1
Mr. Swain has written about extreme weather patterns in California, and how they have shaped the state’s history. The standard pattern is a drought during the summer, with much of the state’s annual rainfall coming in torrents over a few winter days. Heat waves in recent years have become more intense, a consequence of global warming. “The overall trend over decades to more intense and more frequent heat waves is definitely a signal of global warming,” Mr. Swain said. The current heat in Southern California was especially unusual, he said, because some areas closer to the coasts were hotter than, or comparable to, temperatures in the inland deserts.	0
A shrinking Greenland ice sheet – losing mass because of global warming – may be closer to its point of no return than previously estimated. If global average temperatures reach 1.6 degrees C (2.9 degrees F.) above preindustrial levels, the iconic ice sheet probably will tip toward irreversible loss. With a rise already of 0.8 degrees C, global average temperatures already are halfway there. In recent years, global climate talks have focused on trying to hold human-triggered warming to 2 degrees C by the end of the century.	0
Still, underneath the political swordfights are some interesting trends in British attitudes toward defense and foreign policy, which have been laid out in a new study of popular and elite opinion released on Friday by Chatham House, the Royal Institute of International Affairs. Despite current trends, the study found that more than 60 percent of respondents from both the public and selected “opinion formers” — people considered influential in fields like politics, business, media, the arts, health education and the law — believe that Britain should remain a “great power,” the highest level since the survey was first conducted in 2010. Britain should help lead the global response to climate change. While rejecting isolationism, the British are more reluctant to pay the cost of their ambitions, reflexively euroskeptic and increasingly hostile to foreign aid. They are also more ambivalent about Britain’s “special” relationship with Washington, with about 30 percent saying they believe that Britain’s closest ties should be with the European Union rather than the United States, and 25 percent saying the opposite, a reversal from two years ago.	0
Plows cleared roadways only for new gusts of snow to cover their handiwork. Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said plow operators were struggling with whiteout conditions. Snow and ice is going to be frozen in place. The streets were largely empty at the height of the storm, with workers outside hotels and apartment buildings shoveling snow and then, as more fell, shoveling again. Cars inched along roads in Queens, with a number of side streets still waiting to be plowed by the morning rush hour.	1
“We were surprised that the station got washed off the face of the earth,” said Stephen K. Gill, senior scientist of the NOAA division that measures tides and currents. “The wave action tore everything apart.” Climate scientists say they need precise readings from storm surges if they are to predict how much those will worsen with climate change, and to specify risks to nearby coastal areas. The vulnerability of the gauges comes in part from the continuing rise of the sea, which is believed to be caused largely by human emissions of greenhouse gases. “We know our stations are at increasing risk, because the storm surges ride upon sea level,” Mr. Gill said. So the government has embarked on a long-term program of hardening the instruments against future storms.	0
Even so, a spokesman for the lung association, Paul G. Billings, the group’s senior vice president for advocacy and education, said the group was pleased with the regulation. “I don’t think our expectation was that this one proposal or any proposal could solve the nation’s air pollution problem or meet our policy goals with respect to the consumption of coal,” Mr. Billings said. Reducing carbon emissions would also reduce airborne hazards like mercury and ozone. Dr. Thurston, a spokesman for the society, said that with the new regulation, “you’re reducing the most toxic particles and ones associated with the most severe effects.” The effects on health of reducing carbon emissions, unlike those on climate, are “local and immediate, so the people who do the cleanup will get the benefits,” Dr. Thurston said. The best course for public health, he said, would be for the United States to phase out coal burning as soon as possible.	1
The first batch of Arctic air to arrive in the Lower 48 is currently gripping parts of the Midwest, South and East. This will be followed by another reinforcing shot of bitterly cold air during the latter half of the week ahead. The Arctic had the power to put the United States into a deep freeze if you read the Associated Press story published in mid-December. The magnitude and pace of the recent Arctic sea-ice decline and ocean warming is “unprecedented” in at least the past 1,500 years and likely much longer, according to a federal report released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The polar region shows no sign of returning to its reliably frozen state of recent decades, and its permafrost is thawing faster than ever before, the report warned.	1
"When asked about the emissions from exports harming the planet, he said, ""We have no control over that."" As for the president, in recent speeches promoting his plan to reduce global warming Obama has highlighted the progress his administration has made driving down emissions at home. Together, we've held our carbon emissions to levels not seen in about 20 years. ""Since 2006, no country on earth has reduced its total carbon pollution by as much as the United States."" But that's only part of the story."	1
Some of the claims, such as those relating to weather extremes, contradict what both physical theory and empirical data show. The purpose of these claims is obviously to frighten and befuddle the public, and to make it seem like there is evidence where, in fact, there is none. There is no real-world evidence that supports man-made global warming theory. None. Lindzen concluded: What we will be leaving our grandchildren is not a planet damaged by industrial progress, but a record of unfathomable silliness as well as a landscape degraded by rusting wind farms and decaying solar panel arrays.	2
Some companies have come to see the plan as an opportunity to expand the markets for their products. Schüco, one of Germany’s oldest window companies, also designs low-energy doors and facades. Countries like China and India, which rank among the top greenhouse gas emitters globally, and are plagued by worsening air pollution, have shown growing interest in sustainable, environmentally friendly buildings. The Chinese have even asked if Schüco could develop a “smoke window” capable of filtering the outside air, he said. Companies like Florida-Eis in Berlin, which makes specialty ice cream, have embraced low-carbon production and national energy goals, with the company’s owner Olaf Höhn, even selling his private jet and cashing in his retirement plan to invest in a new factory covered in solar panels.	1
Since 2010, Republican campaigns have attacked Democrats who support climate policies to cut carbon pollution as backing a “war on coal” and “job-killing regulations.” That kind of language is likely to escalate after June 2, when President Obama is expected to announce a climate change regulation intended to slash pollution from coal-fired power plants. Charles and David Koch, billionaire industrialist brothers, have put millions of dollars into advocacy groups and super PACs like Americans for Prosperity, which have campaigned aggressively against lawmakers who support climate change policy. The global warming agenda is a loser for them with the American people. Mr. Phillips said that none of the four most vulnerable Democratic senators — Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas — had embraced climate change policy. All four support construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, which Mr. Steyer opposes.	2
“At $50 a barrel, it does not make any sense,” he said in an interview. “These are high-cost resources.” He added that a spill “could be very detrimental for the reputation of a company.” After Shell’s problems, ConocoPhillips and the Norwegian oil giant Statoil suspended their Alaskan Arctic drilling plans. Global warming would open stretches of the Arctic Ocean to shipping and drilling. And the Alaskan Arctic is one of the great untapped frontiers for offshore drilling in the United States, with the potential to produce up to a million barrels a day, or more than 10 percent of current domestic production, according to industry estimates. But many experts warn that Arctic Ocean oil exploration involves high costs and enormous risks.	2
"There have been 350 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere since 1750 and it ""will remain there for centuries, causing our planet to warm further and impacting on all aspects of life on earth,"" said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. ""Future emissions will only compound the situation."" Between 1990 and 2011, carbon dioxide and other gas emissions caused a 30 percent increase in the warming effect on the climate. After carbon dioxide, methane has the biggest effect on climate. Atmospheric concentrations of methane also reached a new high of 1,813 parts per billion in 2011, up 159 percent from pre-industrial levels of about 700 parts per billion."	0
DAVID G. O’BRIEN Port Jefferson Station, N.Y. To the Editor: Re “Political Split Awaits a Pope Who Is Difficult to Pigeonhole” (news analysis, Sept. 21): Pope Francis’ recent declaration on climate change has made me proud of the Catholic Church. By acknowledging and coming down on the right side of one of the most important moral issues in the world right now, he is bringing hope to millions of people. His visit to the United States will inspire Congress to work across the aisle toward solutions to climate change, whether through a carbon tax or through other methods that will reduce our carbon footprint fast. LINA BIRD Pasadena, Calif. To the Editor: Re “How the Pope Might Renew the Church,” by Francis A. Quinn (Op-Ed, Sept. 19): Bishop Quinn’s proposals for reform, while alluring in their boldness, are actually shortsighted. Mainline Protestant denominations have already adopted his suggestions (married clergy, female ordination, communion for the divorced and remarried), but this has not stanched the flow of members from their ranks.	0
Worldwide, they estimate that, although they account for just 6 percent of the earth’s surface, the world’s wetlands – bogs, tundras, mangroves, swamps, and marshes – store between 10 and 20 percent of its terrestrial carbon. That’s an amount nearly equal the 771 gigatons already in the atmosphere. The carbon released will further warm the planet. “It’s a feedback loop,” says Eugene Turner, a professor at Louisiana State University’s Coastal Ecology Institute in Baton Rouge, who attended the Brazil conference. Sixty percent of the world’s wetlands have already been lost during the past century, according to conference organizers.	0
But sea ice cover in the Antarctic is changing, and scientists see the influence of climate change, although they say natural climate variability may be at work, too. “The truth is, we don’t fully understand what’s going on,” said Ted Maksym, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Unlike the Arctic, where sharp declines in recent decades in the ice that floats on sea surfaces have been linked to warming, sea ice in the Antarctic has actually increased. Averaged over the entire Antarctic coast, the increase is slight — about 1 percent a decade. At the same time, larger increases and decreases are being seen on certain parts of the continent.	2
At issue is the urban heat-island effect, long recognized as raising temperatures in urban areas above those of the surrounding countryside. The largest impact comes at night, when sunlight absorbed during the day rises from dark pavement and roof materials, and combines with heat generated by the production and use of energy. The impact of urban heat on rising global average temperatures is tiny. In a study published two years ago, for example, researchers at Stanford University estimated that globally, the urban heat-island effect represents between 2 and 4 percent of the warming that rising greenhouse gases have driven. But locally, it can be significant.	2
Cumulative GDP losses could reach $4.8 trillion by 2030, he estimated. In response, environmental groups say that many industry-backed studies fudge the fact that they are talking about reductions in the future growth of GDP and income, not absolute cuts from today’s levels. Alternative-energy technologies will not advance and ignore jobs that might be created in new low-carbon industries. Furthermore, almost all studies that predict direct economic consequences ignore the costs of inaction, according to the NRDC. Over the next century, average temperatures in most of the US could rise 13 degrees, producing hurricane damage, real estate losses, and increased energy and water costs of almost $1.9 trillion annually, claims a report from Tufts University commissioned by the NRDC.	1
At the same time, the Group of Eight leading economic powers meeting in Japan failed to set any near-term goals to reduce emissions. The group’s soft, conditional goals for 2050 will be too little, too late, many environmentalists say. De-carbonization is not happening fast enough. The need for geoengineering is “almost certain,” he says. The attitude among tech-friendly environmentalists, sometimes called “Bright Greens,” has been shifting in favor of geoengineering, Mr. Cascio says.	0
Others have argued that papal infallibility does not apply to matters of science. In April, a group of self-described climate skeptics, led by the Heartland Institute, a libertarian group, came to Rome to protest. Fossil fuels are the moral choice for the developing world. Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo of Argentina, who is also chancellor of the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Sciences, has sharply rebutted the criticism and postulated that many of the attacks have been underwritten by oil companies or influenced by conservative American interests, including the Tea Party. “This is a ridiculous thing, completely,” Bishop Sorondo said in an interview at the Vatican.	2
He is withering in his contempt for man-made global warming theory, as he demonstrated in some scientific detail at the annual lecture of the Global Warming Policy Foundation in London, hosted by its president (Margaret Thatcher’s Chancellor of the Exchequer) Lord Lawson. You can read the full text here. The global warming scare has little to do with science. Hence his lecture title: Global Warming for the Two Cultures. This was a reference to the influential lecture given in the Fifties by the novelist and physical chemist CP Snow in which he decried the scientific ignorance among the supposedly educated elite.	2
"Here, too, regional differences appear. The Laptev Sea and the Bering Sea posted temperatures 7.2 degrees F above the 1981-2010 average, while the Barents Sea above Norway was close to its 1981-to-2010 average. During the past 15 years, the retreat of summer sea ice has led to a 5 percent increase in the amount of energy the Arctic Ocean has taken up. Some researchers had suggested that warming over an increasingly exposed Arctic Ocean should have led to an increase in evaporation and hence increased cloudiness in the summer. As that happens, the clouds, instead of sea ice, could act as a break on warming and perhaps on sea-ice loss there by reflecting sunlight back into space But after analyzing data on clouds, the solar radiation the Arctic Ocean absorbs, and sea ice, the data showed ""no long-term trend in clouds during the summer,"" said Jennifer Kay, a scientist at CIRES who focuses on Arctic climate."	1
The same agency reported this figure shot back up in 2014 to just over 19 million barrels per day in 2014, which suggests that demand is currently falling into some range between 18 and 20 million barrels per day on average, but that it is not immune to surges. They also presented a conceivable way the auto industry could evolve in the coming decades to maximize fuel efficiency in autos, and possibly one day abandon the internal combustion engine altogether. The auto industry is on the cusp of redefining its relationship with fossil fuels and is on its way to becoming more of a mainstream concept. The EIA's 2014 Annual Energy Outlook predicts that increasing fuel economy requirements will drive down Americans' consumption of gasoline to just over six million barrels of gasoline per day by the year 2040. Currently Americans burn more than eight million barrels of gasoline per day.	1
“When supply falls below demand, somebody doesn’t have enough food,” said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University climate scientist who helped write the new report. “When some people don’t have food, you get starvation. The poorest people in the world, who have had virtually nothing to do with causing global warming, will be high on the list of victims as climatic disruptions intensify. It cited a World Bank estimate that poor countries need as much as $100 billion a year to try to offset the effects of climate change; they are now getting, at best, a few billion dollars a year in such aid from rich countries. The $100 billion figure, though included in the 2,500-page main report, was removed from a 48-page executive summary to be read by the world’s top political leaders.	0
"Biodiversity’s failing grade for 2010 appears to add conservation to a growing list of environmental issues where the largely harmful effects from human influence are outpacing the ability of political institutions to confront them. But as countries consider next steps toward stemming biodiversity's decline, some conservationists say they see hope in one key difference between preserving biodiversity and, say, dealing with global warming. Dealing with global warming is more akin to buying an insurance policy. It involves accepting some level of economic sacrifice now in exchange for staving off plausible but still-uncertain effects in the future. ""We've got a pretty good case history, built up over the last decade or more, where biodiversity conservation, poverty alleviation, and local livelihood supports have gone hand in hand, we've been able to achieve win-wins,"" Dr. Deutz says."	1
Mr. Abbott said the new target was “about the same as the United States.” But the United States’ stated goal is to reduce emissions between 26 percent and 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025, not 2030. The Australia-based Climate Institute said the American goal would amount to a 41 percent reduction by 2030. This target would see us doing our bit in limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Scientists hope that holding global warming to an increase of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit, will limit the worst effects of climate change. According to the Climate Institute’s calculations, Australia’s goal for 2030 lags behind those of the European Union, Canada, Germany and Britain as well as the United States, if a 2005 benchmark is applied to all of them.	0
Whatever the explanation, much of the Bellingshausen is now ice free for long periods each summer. That allows the relatively warmer waters of the Southern Ocean to flow more freely to the more permanent ice that extends from the land in glaciers and sheets. The combination of the warm ocean and the effects of waves on these glaciers may increase the rate of loss of glacial ice. The consensus now is that there is a net loss of ice from Antarctica’s ice sheets and glaciers, Dr. Maksym added, and it is the melting of this ice, rather than any loss of sea ice, that concerns scientists who study sea-level increases. He cautioned that there was still a lot unknown about Antarctic sea ice, which has been studied far less than Arctic ice.	1
Apparently the six million Jews massacred during the Second World War, not to mention the other tens of millions of casualties, do not measure up to the overarching evils of climate change—at least in the minds of the Berkeley City Council. Droughts, famines, and diseases produced by global warming “have already killed millions of people in the Global South,” the document announces, adding that the earth is “already too hot for safety and justice.” “The global economy’s overshoot of ecological limits and, increasingly climate change, are driving a global fresh water scarcity crisis and the sixth mass extinction of species, which could devastate much of life on earth for the next ten million years,” the resolution warns. Global warming has been behind every catastrophe and uprising on the planet. Climate change “has been linked to the Syrian War, the rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria, as well as the famines, water shortages, and resulting conflict in Yemen, Somalia, and South Sudan,” the document pronounces. Not only present evils, however, but future calamities are also prophesied with astounding exactitude and certainty.	0
Without this trio’s passion, energy and influence, the entire global warming scare might never have happened. But between them they had the necessary skillset to push their pet issue onto the world stage and embed it in global political consciousness. Interest in global warming to snowball. In 1988, thanks to their efforts, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) held its inaugural meeting. It was sold to the world as an impartial body of scientists but it was never any such thing.	1
It costs US $8 which may provide some recompense for his unpaid work, conducted as an extension of his PhD thesis, supervised at James Cook University by Peter Ridd. Ridd is the professor who was hounded out of his job after telling the truth about the Great Barrier Reef: that it wasn’t being destroyed by “global warming.” Since this didn’t accord with the narrative being promoted by his alarmist institution he was fired on the pretext that he had “engaged in a pattern of conduct that misrepresents the nature and conduct of the disciplinary process through publi­cations online and in the media”. It is impossible to know how much global temperatures have really risen. But he estimates that of the 0.6 degrees C that the planet has warmed since 1950, perhaps one third has been exaggerated. So the real figure, he estimates, is a warming of 0.4 degrees C in the last seven decades.	2
(A 2012 Harvard School of Public Health study found that adding a single serving of unprocessed red meat per day increases the risk of death by 13 percent.) Those factors have already driven down beef consumption in the United States by 19 percent since 2005. The proposed carbon tax on beef has no chance of becoming reality. Our politicians continue to regard the beef industry as, well, a sacred cow. And even if the rest of us acknowledge the reality of climate change, we tend to put off actually doing much about it in our own lives.	1
“I don’t mean to say that it’s nothing,” he added, noting that some oil operations will feel its effects more than others. “But relative to oil prices, it’s small.” Mr. Leach, who was part of a group that proposed climate measures to the provincial government of Alberta, estimates that they will add about $2.50 to $3 in American dollars to the price of a barrel of crude oil from Alberta’s oil sands, after adjusting for tax write-offs. Carbon pricing will jeopardize the future of Canadian industry, which generally exports most of its production to the United States. “By far, the United States is our biggest trade and investment partner, and they are also our biggest competitor,” said Ed Fast, a former cabinet minister who is now the Conservative spokesman in Parliament on climate issues. “Carbon pricing at this time is going to be devastating to our economy.	1
The melting of massive glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica is also pushing up the seas – Nasa announced last week that the amount of ice lost annually from Antarctica has tripled since 2012 to an enormous 241bn tons a year. This slowly unfolding scenario is set to pose wrenching choices for many in the US. About 13 million Americans may have to move due to sea level rise by the end of the century, with landlocked states such as Arizona and Wyoming set for a population surge. “My flood insurance bill just went up by $100 this year, it went up $100 the year before,” said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. “People on the waterfront won’t be able to stay unless they are very wealthy.	0
The latest estimates attribute 65 percent of the rise in global average sea levels between 1993 and 2008 to melting ice. Ground water and water stored in reservoirs in effect cancel each other out. By 2030, global average sea levels could rise between three and nine inches over 2000 levels, range from six inches to two feet by 2050, and from 19 to 55 inches by 2100. The IPCC's upper estimate from 2007 projects as much as a 23-inch rise by 2100. For the West Coast, the NRC's figures by century's end are much higher than the IPCC's 2007 projection as well, although different regions take different paths.	1
On an average day, some 100 million tons of carbon dioxide is liberated from oil and coal by combustion, wafting into the air. The gas traps heat in the atmosphere, resulting in the gradual warming that has alarmed scientists and much of the public. But only half of the carbon dioxide stays up there. While scientists know what happens to half of that half — it dissolves into the oceans — the rest is a continuing puzzle. It is taken up by growing plants, but nobody knows exactly where and how.	2
Released enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to prevent another global cool down. Now, millennia later, researchers hope new farming techniques will put some of that carbon back into the ground and help stem the rising tide of global warming. No-till agriculture, in which farmers don’t plow their fields anymore, is one practice said to promote carbon sequestration in the soil.	1
The carcasses of more than 130 mostly young walrus were counted after a stampede in September 2009 at Alaska's Icy Cape. The World Wildlife Fund said walrus have also been gathering in large groups on the Russian side of the Chukchi Sea. The Arctic environment is changing extremely rapidly and it is time for the rest of the world to take notice and also to take action to address the root causes of climate change.

Lovejoy's work, published July 14 in Geophysical Research Letters, does not, however, try to identify which decade-scale natural climate swing is at work. That has fallen to modelers. Climate models could indeed reproduce a hiatus in warming during the 2000s if the model used observed sea-surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific between 1970 and 2012, rather calculating its own ocean temperatures. The hiatus pointed to a multi-decade climate swing known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) as a prime suspect behind the slowdown in warming. A team of Australian and US researchers led by James Risbey, at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization marine and atmospheric research center in Hobart, Tasmania, found similar evidence by taking a subset of climate models used for the most recent reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.	1
By Nov. 13 there had been 72 tropical storms, well below the average of 89. Arctic sea ice shrunk to the sixth lowest level on record in September, while Antarctic sea ice grew to a record extent for the third straight year. The concentration in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas, rose to a new high of 396 parts per million last year. Figures for 2014 were not yet ready. In Lima, delegates from more than 190 countries are trying to lay the groundwork for a global emissions pact that's planned to be adopted next year.	0
Whereas incentives didn’t make much difference at earlier stages, they can now greatly reinforce the new behavior. Resistance can also be avoided by framing the issue differently, says Ted Nordhaus, managing partner at American Environics in Oakland, Calif., a firm that brings psychological and cognitive science to bear on social-change strategies. For example, stressing the idea that human activity is behind global warming can be counterproductive. It can provoke retrenchment and backlash. “When [Al] Gore says this is a moral issue, what people hear is that ‘my lifestyle is immoral,’ ” Mr. Nordhaus says.	2
The standard pattern is a drought during the summer, with much of the state’s annual rainfall coming in torrents over a few winter days. Heat waves in recent years have become more intense, a consequence of global warming, he said, raising the possibility of ever-deadlier fire seasons. The overall trend over decades to more intense and more frequent heat waves is definitely a signal of global warming. The current heat in Southern California was especially unusual, he said, because some areas closer to the coasts were hotter than, or comparable to, temperatures in the inland deserts. The reason is an unusual wind pattern: Instead of cool coastal breezes, hot downward-sloping winds were blowing from the mountains toward the coast.	0
And it can be done, or at least attempted. Not to beat the World War II comparisons too heavily, but the United States built 2,000 airplanes in 1939; by 1944 that had become over 96,000, at a time when naysayers doubted 50,000 was a reachable number. We can devise and build flood barriers; we can cap and control the spewing of carbon and methane into the air. It’s a matter of will, not one of magic. “They” will not build a big umbrella that will reflect all that excess sun back into space; “they” will not compress and suck all that carbon underground; “they” will not release the secret plans for nuclear fusion “they’ve” been hiding.	1
But for several years, evidence has been accumulating that at least large parts of that ice sheet are vulnerable, too. The new study confirms previous findings that how much of the world’s ice will melt is closely linked to how much total fossil fuel humans burn. A rapid shift away from those fuels over coming decades would preserve much of the ice, or at least slow the melting drastically. On the other hand, if the use of fossil fuels were to continue rising at the same rate it rose over the past century, the estimated deposits would be burned by about the middle of the 22nd century, Dr. Caldeira said, and complete destruction of the world’s land ice would be well underway. The exact timing is open to question, he said, but “the idea that most of it would melt, I believe, is a robust result.” Scientists focus on melting ice in part because the consequences are relatively easy to visualize.	0
But then, Vollmann is an extreme person: his ascetic, Luddite lifestyle – he doesn’t have a cellphone or use email – at one point led police to suspect that he might be the Unabomber. What’s not clear from the interview is why he is so convinced that climate change is such a threat. People are so addicted to their carbon fuelled lifestyles. Well, we all have beliefs, feelings, and interests. They tend to be centered around our own personal comfort and our aspirations to make tomorrow better than today.	1
But the bullet points convey a certainty that many scientists say does not yet exist. Scientists agree that evidence is growing that warmer weather is having an effect on health, but they say it is only one part of an immensely complex set of forces that are influencing health. Global travel and trade, not climate change, brought the first cases of chikungunya, a mosquito-borne tropical disease, to Florida. Temperatures may be rising, but overall deaths from heat are not, in part because the march of progress has helped people adapt — air conditioning is more ubiquitous, for example, and the treatment of heart disease, a major risk for heat-related mortality, has improved. The resurgence of forests in the eastern United States and the subsequent increase in the deer population have helped drive a sharp growth in ticks and Lyme disease.	2
Researchers looked at 10,000-year-old fossils found in an underwater cave on Abaco. They compared them with fossils from the island that date to 1,000 to 3,000 years ago, along with data from current vertebrate populations. During the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago, some 17 bird species went extinct on Abaco because of a warming, wetter climate and rising sea levels. “All of these birds were open country birds that preferred grassy, dry, cool climates,” said David Steadman, the curator of ornithology at the Florida Museum of Natural History and one of the study’s authors. At that time, there were no humans on the island.	1
Global warming has not caused an increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes. Climate alarmists such Michael Mann, Kerry Emanuel, and Al Gore often claim that hurricanes are among the extreme weather events that have been exacerbated by man’s selfishness, greed, and refusal to amend his carbon-guzzling lifestyle. But there is “little evidence” that this is so, according to the study’s author Paul Homewood.	2
"But in Europe, climate change is likely to mean a new flood of immigrants from Africa and other poorer countries, according to a new report. That was one of the issues before the heads of state from the 27-member European Union as they gathered in Brussels Thursday and Friday to address climate change and, in particular, the security threats it raises. Unchecked climate change could not only cause a flood of new environmental migrants to Europe. Climate change, the report says, is a ""threat multiplier"" which ""intensifies existing trends, tensions, and instability."" European leaders say they have an important role to play in leading the world towards an agreement to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions – and that's on this meeting's agenda, too."	0
But now we are supposed to roll over and play socialist because the Holy Consensus says Climate Change will wipe us out by 2050. Sorry, no. I am also old enough to remember when Climate Change was called Global Warming and then had to be re-branded because God made it snow every time Al Gore gave a speech. Those 13 items listed above are not a joke, are not sarcasm, are not an exaggeration on my part. Each and every one of those now-debunked doomsday prophecies were not only taken seriously by scientists and the media, but by left-wing authoritarians at home and abroad as a means to control people through the horrors of central planning.	2
"The reason Evangelicals should care about climate change is ""not because we worship the earth,"" Hayhoe says. It's recognizing that the impact is likely to be most severe in some of the most impoverished areas of the world. Doing something about climate change is loving our global neighbor. ""It's about caring about people who are already hurting around the world. And it's about caring for our children and future generations, who are going to inherit this earth that God has given us."""	0
"It confirms scientists&apos; computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the United Nations, which releases regular climate change reports. ""It&apos;s a big deal"" because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said lead author Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado. Even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion. ""Any flooding concerns that coastal communities have for 2100 may occur over the next few decades,"" Oregon State University coastal flooding expert Katy Serafin said in an email. Of the 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) of sea level rise in the past quarter century, about 55 percent is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice."	1
"By some estimates there were as few as 5,000 polar bears in the 1950s when hunting for sport and profit was far less regulated. Today, scientists believe there are 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears, though this is still about 60 percent below historic levels. The loss of Arctic sea ice, which bears rely on for hunting and denning, is accelerating to record levels due to global warming. As a result, US Geological Survey scientists recently warned that projected changes in sea-ice conditions could lead to the loss of about two-thirds of the world's polar bear population by midcentury. ""Global warming is already causing serious damage and disruptions to wildlife and ecosystems, and reliable projections call for significant additional damage and disruptions,"" more than 600 scientists warned in a letter to members of Congress last week."	0
In certain ways, the findings are reassuring. They offer no reason, for instance, to revise the sea-level forecast for the coming century. The rise of the sea would not likely exceed three feet in that period, and would probably be less. While some island nations may be wiped out by a rise of that magnitude, experts believe most major cities could be protected from it, though at a likely cost in the trillions of dollars. The ice sheets respond slowly enough to changes in the climate that it simply takes longer than a century for large-scale melting to begin.	1
When the full appeals court declined to rehear the case, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh dissented, and he identified the ground that would turn out to interest the Supreme Court. He said the agency had gone astray in revising the text of the statute. The task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important. “The framers of the Constitution,” he added, “did not grant the executive branch the authority to set economic and social policy as it sees fit.” The agency said its regulation of tailpipe emissions also required regulation of emissions from stationary sources under two permitting programs. The Clean Air Act says those programs cover all sources that can annually emit 100 or 250 tons of the relevant pollutant, a threshold that works tolerably well for conventional air pollutants like lead and carbon monoxide.	0
What he also knows is that fossil fuels are looking quite cheap right now. Suddenly, all those millions Soros has given campaign groups to talk them down must seem like money well spent. This is especially true of the fossil fuel which for years has been vilified by eco-campaigners as the dirtiest of them all. Soros tried to position himself as an enemy of coal, stating at the 2009 Copenhagen climate change summit, “There is no magic bullet for climate change, but there is a lethal bullet: coal.” In the last quarter, however, he invested $4.7 million into Peabody Energy Corporation, the largest “pure play coal company” in the United States, according to the company’s website. Peabody sold 188 million tons of coal to electric utilities in 2016.	2
Russia has been particularly concerning to me, where they are getting 90-plus-degree temperatures up near the shores of the Arctic Ocean. These are regions that get abnormally cold, and in the clashing of that very cold and very warm, it often leads to very intense storms, [like the] five or six nor’easters that impacted the eastern seaboard. Global warming creates these extreme heat events. MJ: You wrote about northern Siberia experiencing record-high temperatures. Most people tend to associate Siberia with the coldest place on Earth.	0
Another risk, judged to be moderately likely over the coming century, is that rising heat in the upper ocean could result in reduced oxygen in the deep. The worst-case scenario would be the creation of huge zones with too little oxygen for sea creatures to survive, with unknown consequences for the overall ecology of the ocean, the panel said. The possibility that a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, believed to be especially vulnerable to a warming ocean, would greatly increase the rate of sea level rise. It found that risk, in the near term, to be “unknown but probably low.” The National Research Council is a nonprofit group in Washington that frequently oversees studies on major scientific questions; this study was commissioned by several government agencies.	0
"""We showed the effect on the ice, and processes like that of course will make a difference for shorter-term forecasts,"" he says. The event highlights another factor critical to ice forecasts, notes the National Ice Center's Clemente-Colon. To get any improvement in ice forecasting, you really have to improve weather forecasting in the Arctic. Among other things, that means more weather sensors in a sensor-starved part of the world. To help fill that gap, NOAA inked an agreement last year with the oil industry to share forecast-relevant data from instruments on oil and gas platforms, Clemente-Colon says."	1
“Thibs,” of course, is Tom Thibodeau, the coach who lost his job on Thursday. “Sorry to see him go but expect he will be snatched up soon by another team.” On a more serious note, Mr. Obama used the chat, conducted from the hurricane center, to paint a dire picture of the consequences of climate change. More severe weather events lead to displacement, scarcity, stressed populations; all increase likelihood of global conflict. Mr. Obama is no stranger to Miami, having already visited twice this year. But he came back to headline a couple of $33,400-a-ticket Democratic National Committee fund-raisers at Coconut Grove homes on Wednesday night, for a total take of around $3 million, before taking care of official business on Thursday.	0
Mr. Whitehouse is a co-sponsor of “Fair Share” tax legislation that would collect an additional $70 billion from wealthy taxpayers by closing loopholes. He also backs a new tax on carbon emissions, though his motivation is environmental rather than budgetary; he would return tax proceeds to businesses through lower corporate rates and to individuals through tax rebates and other benefits. The carbon tax faces a steep uphill fight, even as climate change assumes a larger role on the political stage. Nor is there much prospect of massive increases in marginal tax rates, though Thomas Piketty, the French economist whose recent book accelerated the income inequality debate, argues that top rates could reach 80 percent without harming the economy. Yet Mrs. Clinton has not ruled out an increase in the 39.6 percent rate that her husband and President Obama both signed into law.	1
Passing up opportunities in the shallow waters of the warming Arctic is difficult. “We, as a country, we are petroholics,” said Thomas Nilsen, who runs a news site called The Independent Barents Observer. Climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels. At the same time, we depend so much on the income from the oil. Just like alcoholics, we do want to stop, but we don’t know how.”	0
"The most obvious cause is the ""density effect,"" he says: There are so many herring that each one eats less, making them smaller. And smaller herring could mean that feeding tuna have to work harder for each meal. Changing oceanic conditions driven, perhaps, by global warming, may be responsible for the tuna's woes. Warmer temperatures explain the abundance of young tuna in the Gulf of Maine. ""These are fish normally found off the mid-Atlantic states,"" says Lutcavage."	0
“It’s two completely different worlds,” says Rosanne Barone of the two sides of the 7th. She’s a program director at Texas Campaign for the Environment and assessed the impact of pollution across Houston. West Houston is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change, in the form of freak storms and floods. It has suffered extensive flooding from Harvey and at least two other storms in the past five years. In fact, Rep. Culberson has used last year’s hurricane as a major talking point during his campaign, name-dropping the storm in more than half of his emails to voters this year.	0
Ms. Khatun now lives in a bamboo shack that sits below sea level about 50 yards from a sagging berm. She spends her days collecting cow dung for fuel and struggling to grow vegetables in soil poisoned by salt water. This area will be inundated as sea levels rise and storm surges increase, and a cyclone or another disaster could easily wipe away her rebuilt life. But Ms. Khatun is trying to hold out at least for a while — one of millions living on borrowed time in this vast landscape of river islands, bamboo huts, heartbreaking choices and impossible hopes. As the world’s top scientists meet in Yokohama, Japan, this week, at the top of the agenda is the prediction that global sea levels could rise more than three feet by 2100.	1
But will anyone believe the good news? I’ve just been reading two new reports on the economics of fighting climate change: a big study by a blue-ribbon international group, the New Climate Economy Project, and a working paper from the International Monetary Fund. Strong measures to limit carbon emissions would have hardly any negative effect on economic growth, and might actually lead to faster growth. This may sound too good to be true, but it isn’t. These are serious, careful analyses.	1
"The continued presence of the cooling aerosols was crucial. If both types of aerosols declined, the net effect likely would be warming. Reducing black-carbon soot would have a net cooling effect. ""This is geoengineering made in heaven,"" he says, referring to proposals to moderate global warming by injecting cooling aerosols into the atmosphere. The team holds that curbing emissions of black-carbon soot is critical for limiting global warming over the next 50 years."	1
The study sketches out a past where humans were influencing the climate long before the Industrial Revolution, where the use of fossil fuels for the manufacturing of goods, generation of electricity, and transportation has allowed tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere. Widespread deforestation for agriculture and urban development has also spurred the release of greenhouse gases, causing the planet to warm by around 1 C over the past century. The world has little over a decade to drastically reduce emissions or face increasingly severe storms, drought, heatwaves, coastal flooding, and food insecurity. The revegetation of the Americas after European arrival aided declines of global carbon content in the air, dropping by around seven to 10 parts of carbon dioxide for every million molecules of air in the atmosphere. This compares to the 3ppm of carbon dioxide that humanity is currently adding to the atmosphere every year through the burning of fossil fuels.	0
"Over the same century, Australia's average daily temperature rose 1.3 degrees F. (0.7 degrees C), with the sharpest increase since the 1950s. The research concluded that the birds were likely downsizing because smaller bodies shed heat faster than larger ones. Global warming is likely to be causing the changes. She said she suspected that other Australian birds beyond the species studied were also shrinking and the trend will accelerate in the future as a result of global climate change. ""Simply because the predictions are that the warming is going to increase over the coming decades, so you might expect this (shrinking) response to increase as well,"" Gardner said."	1
“Traditionally, you think of climate change as the cause of more traditional environmental groups, but this is a much broader array of activists.” More than two-thirds of Americans believe there is “solid evidence” the earth is getting warmer, according to a Pew Research Center survey this year. Of these, two-thirds also believe this warming is caused by human activities – though there is a deep partisan divide on the issue. Even so, global warming ranked second to last on a list of 20 priorities for the president and Congress this year. And Americans are far less concerned about the issue than people in other countries.

California’s initiative will give grants to farmers who take steps to reverse that nutrient loss. Those could include adding compost on rangelands or seeding fields between harvests with so-called cover crops such as grasses and mustards, which add organic matter to the soil. Such measures could eliminate from the air the equivalent of millions of tons of carbon dioxide a year. For now, the soils initiative is funded with just $7.5 million, a drop in the bucket for a state with more than 76,000 farms. But officials hope it can be expanded after demonstrating enough interest from farmers.	1
"Worldwide, thousands of underground coal fires burn, with perhaps 1,300 in Indonesia alone, says Dr. Stracher, who is editing a four-volume scientific compilation of coal and peat fires around the world. He estimates that fires are burning in at least 20 nations, but notes that researchers have little understanding of their environmental damage and the scope of their impact on human health. The truth is, we don't really have a good regional or global estimate of emissions from these fires. ""It's quite possible the emissions from these fires should be a significant part of the climate change models. We just don't know."""	1
There’s a lot of it, too. Peter Erickson, a senior scientist with the Stockholm Environment Institute, a research organization, found that emissions from Norway’s oil exports this year will be 10 times as much as Norway’s domestic carbon emissions. Norway should curb the supply of fossil fuels, rather than just trimming demand among its own people. “Norway has set out to be a global leader in climate action, yet continued expansion of oil and gas production could eclipse the benefits of Norway’s domestic emission reduction efforts,” Mr. Erickson and his colleague Adrian Down wrote in a recent paper. It’s one of the problems built into the Paris climate accord that President Trump promises to leave, Mr. Erickson argued: Countries are measured by how much they reduce their own emissions, within their own borders, not by the impact they have on the planet as a whole.	0
Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican who represents Fresno, was not invited to Friday’s event. He attributes California’s water crisis not to weather, but to interference by the federal government. Global warming is nonsense. He criticized the federal government for shutting off portions of California’s system of water irrigation and storage, and diverting water into a program for freshwater salmon. “There was plenty of water.	2
In poorer countries, lives are at stake: Hundreds of millions of people get their protein primarily from reef fish, and the loss of that food supply could become a humanitarian crisis. With this latest global bleaching in its third year, reef scientists say they have no doubt as to the responsible party. The coral reefs would be at risk if human society kept burning fossil fuels at a runaway pace, releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean. Emissions continued to rise, and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs. “Climate change is not a future threat,” Professor Hughes said.	0
At the time, lawmakers worried about increased dependence on imported oil, but the United States is now on track to become the world’s largest oil and gas producer. Energy companies, in turn, have campaigned aggressively to lift the ban on crude oil exports that was imposed after the crippling 1973 Arab oil embargo. Climate changes caused by the burning of fossil fuels have begun to harm the global economy. Mr. Obama has proposed a series of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on power plants and cars in an effort to curb greenhouse gas pollution, but Republicans have said the rules would force employers to eliminate jobs. Both issues — how the United States responds to the oil boom and to climate change — will be top priorities for the next president.	0
Imagine for a moment if you had to wait for a sunny or windy day to get New York running again. GWYNETH CRAVENS East Hampton, N.Y. From a climate perspective, the smart strategy is to hold on to nuclear plants until their power can be replaced with carbon-free electricity. That’s why it’s worth paying attention to the recent landmark agreement between Pacific Gas and Electric, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. As far as I can tell, this is the first time that the announcement of a coming nuclear plant retirement will not be accompanied by the dismal reality that power-sector carbon emissions will dramatically increase, starting the day after the plant retires.	1
"Indeed, the stifling orthodoxy of climate alarmism has silenced key voices of dissent — weakening the scientific strength of the theory. When popularizers like Bill Nye brush off critiques with unscientific claims that human beings cause ""one hundred percent"" of climate change, it's time to rethink the underlying claims of the movement. Carbon emissions have some effect on the atmosphere. Even if the global warming theory were completely proven, desperate efforts like the Green New Deal — which Klobuchar foolishly endorsed — would do extremely little to stem the tide of climate change. Furthermore, if Ball and Harris are correct and cooling is a far more disastrous threat to humanity than warming, perhaps any efforts to stop global warming may actually leave humanity worse off."	1
As such developments take hold, the once unthinkable has begun to seem plausible, if by no means inevitable: a linked global carbon price high enough to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. “We might be witnessing the birth of a new system, without quite realizing it,” said Glen P. Peters, a climate researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo. A market mechanism can reach more deeply into the economy than any other approach, changing the behavior even of people and companies that might not necessarily care about global warming. The Wisconsin dairymen perhaps serve as an example of that. Even as the methane-powered generator roared on his property, John T. Pagel said he was not convinced that the climatic changes happening in the United States were a result of human emissions.	1
The number of ponds that freeze over in winter has fallen dramatically in recent years, making the sport less accessible in countries like Canada, where many children first start playing the game outdoors. Going green is a way to address a long-term threat, not just save money. Natural ice conditions are diminishing across the globe, particularly in Canada. “As we look at the future of the game, it’s about getting more kids involved and creating a long glide path.”	1
"""But I also believe public and expert opinion on the risks and benefits of nuclear power has changed."" Nevertheless, many environmentalists disagree, and are disappointed at having to reopen a battle they thought was won long ago. It is most crucial to combat global warming. Environment America, a federation of green groups, stated in a recent report that energy efficiency and renewable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal can do the job faster and cheaper. The report estimates that building 100 new reactors would require a $600 billion investment – but that same amount invested in other carbon-free technologies could cut at least twice as much carbon pollution by 2030."	0

"""It was one of our images,"" says a bemused Dr. Parkinson. ""But it wasn't our interpretation."") Antarctica's sea ice has expanded by about half a percent a year. Declines in sea ice recorded between 2000 and 2002 have significantly moderated the overall rise. These long-term data have let scientists tease out relationships between Antarctic sea ice and natural climate variations, such as swings between El Niño and La Niña in the tropical Pacific."	2
"""We are all responsible for protecting our wildlife, even the largest of corporations,"" Colorado U.S. Attorney David M. Gaouette said in 2009 when announcing Exxon Mobil had pleaded guilty and would pay $600,000 for killing 85 birds in five states, including Wyoming. The large death toll at wind farms shows how the renewable energy rush comes with its own environmental consequences, trade-offs the Obama administration is willing to make in the name of cleaner energy. We have to get off of carbon. ""But at what cost? In this case, the cost is too high."""	0
Among Republicans, 48 percent say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who supports fighting climate change, a result that Jon A. Krosnick, a professor of political science at Stanford University and an author of the survey, called “the most powerful finding” in the poll. Many Republican candidates question the science of climate change or do not publicly address the issue. Policies designed to curb global warming would hurt the economy. Although the poll found that climate change was not a top issue in determining a person’s vote, a candidate’s position on climate change influences how a person will vote. For example, 67 percent of respondents, including 48 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of independents, said they were less likely to vote for a candidate who said that human-caused climate change is a hoax.	2
It was titled “Global warming: the origin and nature of the alleged scientific consensus.” No wonder Lindzen sounds so weary when he talks about this subject. He’s probably the world’s greatest professor of atmospheric physics. The whole global warming thing is a scam. The flaws in the alarmist position Lindzen exposed in 1992 remain the same today: the global warming scare story depends on hopelessly inadequate computer models which place too much emphasis on man-made CO2 and which therefore produce a “disturbingly arbitrary” picture of the state of climate. What Lindzen also noted in this paper was another thing that remains true today: the remarkable proclivity of all manner of diverse groups to leap on the climate bandwagon.	2
The question is whether fear is the right emotion to play on to get people to sit up, listen, and take action. According to Grist‘s own Eric Holthaus, who’s been writing about climate change for more than a decade, it’s not. Whatever it takes to decarbonize the global economy rapidly. So Grist asked the two climate writers to discuss telling stories about the end of the world, facing their climate fears, and finding a sliver of hope in the face of studies detailing the melting of Antarctic ice. (The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.)	0
"The 10 warmest years on record have all occurred since 1998. ""It's never surprising to see a record-high temperature set these days,"" Professor Zaitchik says. We are seeing a long-term global warming trend. Last month was the 38th consecutive June that surpassed 20th-century averages, and global temperatures have not dipped below last century’s average since February 1985. The June data will hardly surprise residents of California and the Southwest, who have seen their own local record-breaking heat in recent months."	0
On Tuesday, Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator of Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, announced a plan to prop up coal-burning plants that would, by the agency’s own reckoning, lead to hundreds of additional deaths a year from respiratory diseases. Australia, at least, has not pulled out of the Paris agreement — though America’s withdrawal is cited by Australian conservatives as an argument against setting emissions targets — and it remains committed to reduce energy emission levels in 2030 to 26 percent below those of 2005. Steps should be taken against global warming even if they are costly. Ideology and idiocy, of course, are not limited to climate policy or to any country. But it is especially dismaying when science-denying hacks and self-serving industries block action that is in the obvious and urgent interest of all humanity.	0
Climate change seemed like a godsend for Kiribati, the Pacific island nation threatened by rising seas. The result of that promise was the Green Climate Fund. But Kiribati — like many of the poorest countries most vulnerable to climate change — has yet to see any project funding.	1
When a ship carrying scientists and adventure tourists became stuck in ice in the Antarctic late last month, climate change skeptics had a field day. On Twitter and other social media sites, they pointed out that a group whose journey was meant to highlight the effects of global warming was trapped by a substance that was supposed to be melting. Global warming idiots out of danger. The episode had little connection to climate change — shifting winds had caused loose pack ice to jam against the ship — and this was far from the first time that a ship had been trapped, even in the Antarctic summer. But sea ice cover in the Antarctic is changing, and scientists see the influence of climate change, although they say natural climate variability may be at work, too.	2
BERKELEY, Calif. — DOES global warming weaken tornadoes? Yes, you read that correctly. The explanation lies with global warming. That is certainly not the popular impression. Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, commented in May on the powerful tornadoes that had just hit Oklahoma.	1
Mr. Scott’s videotaped responses — the first was “Goodbye” — are sent to the state’s news media and to activist groups. In Michigan, where concern is rising over the impact of climate change on the Great Lakes, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, Representative Gary Peters, is challenging his Republican opponent, Terri Lynn Land, to say whether she believes human activity causes global warming. The leader of a company that disputes a threat from global warming has no place at an institution where scientists have underscored the seriousness of the problem and administrators. The university says Mr. Boyce of Peabody Energy is staying on its board — and the students say they will keep protesting until that changes. Julia Ho, one of the protesters, said, “I think it’s pretty fair to say that this issue isn’t going away.”	0
China's challenge is compounded by its efforts to turn over energy decisions to its provinces, which have fewer incentives and less money to build coal-fired power plants that use the latest technology. More broadly, scientists tracking long-term changes in greenhouse-gas emissions found two years ago that between 2000 and 2005, emissions rose four times faster than they had during the previous 10 years. During this century, half of the energy the world needs will come from fossil fuels. Meanwhile, buried in the footnotes of a broad negotiating road map that came out of the global climate talks in Bali last December, lie references to an emissions objective around which many countries hope to frame talks. If adopted, industrial countries would be required to reduce emissions from 25 to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.	1
The difference in ocean-surface temperatures from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age was about 0.72 degrees F (0.4 degrees C) over 900 years, he said. For comparison, sea-surface temperatures have gone up 1.5 degrees F (0.8 degrees C) since 1901, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data. Climate scientists centuries in the future won&apost be able to see any hints of the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age in Pacific data. Nevertheless, the findings are important for today. Taking the deep ocean into account will help climate modelers develop better estimates for future climate change, Gebbie said.	2
A recent study by the Union of Concerned Scientists on the effects of global warming in the Northeast concluded that, under some scenarios, “Only western Maine is projected to retain a reliable ski season by the end of the century, and only northern New Hampshire would support a snowmobiling season longer than two months.” The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment of 2004 reported that Arctic temperatures are rising at nearly twice the rate of the rest of the world (up to 14 degrees F. in the next 100 years), reducing sea ice and melting frozen soils. The scale of this climatic shift may completely change the culture of the Arctic. Global warming impacts are far from monolithic. But the overall trend is clear: It’s getting warmer, and winter is losing its intensity and duration. “ Winter’s retreat may be sad for children intent on sledding, but it also augurs badly for the economy, especially for businesses reliant on snow.	2
"""Antarctic sea ice hasn't seen these big reductions we've seen in the Arctic. This is not a surprise to us,"" said climate scientist Mark Serreze, director of the NSIDC. Well, everything is OK because the big changes in the Arctic are essentially balanced by what's happening in the Antarctic. This is simply not true."" [Former Global Warming Skeptic Makes a 'Total Turnaround'] Projections made from climate models all predict that global warming should impact Arctic sea ice first and most intensely, Serreze said."	2
Areas around the Ross Sea, for example, have seen large increases in ice, while in the Bellingshausen and along the peninsula, ice cover has declined sharply. (The area where the research ship became stuck, west of the Ross Sea, has had a slight increase in ice cover over the past 35 years.) The changes in those seas are related to north-south winds that circulate clockwise around a stationary zone of increasingly lower-pressure air. That brings warmer air from the north into the Bellingshausen Sea and peninsula, pushing ice against the coast and melting some of it, and colder air from the south into the Ross Sea, which spreads the ice away from the coast and creates more of it. But why that low-pressure air is getting lower is still a subject of debate.	1
It’s known as geoengineering, specifically “solar radiation management,” and while it sounds a bit bonkers, researchers are seriously studying the possibility of such a drastic campaign—including potential effects on everything from hurricanes to ecosystems. Last week in the journal Nature, scientists look back at the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and Mexico’s El Chichón in 1982 to give us a glimpse at how geoengineering might affect another critical global system: agriculture. The technique would bring down soaring global temperatures, which would help avoid heat-stressing crops. Bad news is, the solar shading that would come with geoengineering would negatively affect crops, likely wiping out the gains from lower temperatures. “If we imagine geoengineering as an experimental surgery, our findings suggest that the damages or side effects from the surgery are just as bad as the original disease,” says UC Berkeley agricultural economist Jonathan Proctor, lead author of the new study.	1
“I was in a rush, and all I noticed was the word ‘climate’ in a New York Times headline,” she said. “That made me open it rather than throw it out.” The cover letter inside, however, made the book’s premise clear. Well over 90 percent of published climate scientists have concluded that recent global warming is both real and mostly the result of human activity. For example, a study in 2010 found that 97 percent of the 200 most-published authors of climate-related papers held the consensus position, and a survey in 2013 of 4,014 abstracts of peer-reviewed climate papers found 97 percent agreement. The Heartland-distributed book disputes the methods used in these and similar surveys but provides no definitive counterarguments against the overall weight of evidence.	0

It was the numbers – in her case, the nonfinancial ones – that made the case for Ms. Kurth, president of a family environmental-education foundation.

Also in July, the Obama administration announced a plan to triple the renewable energy capacity in federally subsidized housing by 2020, as well as plans to make wind and solar energy more accessible to low- and middle-income households. Renewable energy is attractive to companies like HP not just because green initiatives are good publicity or make for happier shareholders who are concerned about acting on climate change. Energy sources like wind and solar are not as vulnerable to market fluctuations as fossil fuels are. Once a company buys into renewable energy, the cost of paying for the utility over time is lower.

As the president unveiled new rules that seek to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from US power plants, we’re reminded of the dramatic progress we’ve already made as a nation in recent years. No nation has reduced carbon emissions more over the past eight years than the US. The not-so-secret weapon in America’s arsenal? Vast domestic supplies of clean, affordable natural gas that are transforming the economic, environmental, and energy security possibilities of our nation.	1
It’s entirely avoidable. As the authors of the paper have argued in response to the coverage, implying otherwise is the same as giving up just as the fight gets tough. A domino effect will kick in if global temperatures rise. The Guardian: A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile. This kind of framing is almost perfectly engineered to foster hopelessness.	0
But they receive aid and comfort from other groups, including some on the left, who have their own reasons for getting it wrong. Where is the new optimism about climate change and growth coming from? A well-thought-out strategy of emissions control, in particular one that puts a price on carbon via either an emissions tax or a cap-and-trade scheme, would cost much less than the usual suspects want you to think. But the economics of climate protection look even better now than they did a few years ago. On one side, there has been dramatic progress in renewable energy technology, with the costs of solar power, in particular, plunging, down by half just since 2010.	1
Recently, the nine states decided to cut their emissions cap by 45 percent and to let carbon prices rise. They have nearly doubled, to $4 a ton, and the revisions are expected to spur still more clean-energy investment. In the long run, carbon markets will make a substantial contribution only if they can be tied together across political boundaries. That would allow polluters to search the world for the cheapest ways of cutting emissions. To a limited extent, such networking has already begun.	1
The World Bank study comes as almost 200 nations will meet in Doha, Qatar, from Nov. 26 to Dec. 7 to try to extend the Kyoto Protocol, the existing plan for curbing greenhouse gas emissions by developed nations that runs to the end of the year. They have been trying off and on since Kyoto was agreed in 1997 to widen limits on emissions but have been unable to find a formula acceptable to both rich and poor nations. The main responsibility to cut emissions lies with developed nations, which had a headstart in sparking global warming. Combating climate change also poses a challenge for the poverty-fighting World Bank: how to balance global warming with immediate energy needs in poor countries. In 2010, the World Bank approved a $3.75 billion loan to develop a coal-fired power plant in South Africa despite lack of support from the United States, Netherlands and Britain due to environmental concerns.	0
The panel said many of the world’s coral reefs, a vital source of fish that feed millions of people, already seemed fated to die within decades. Another risk, judged to be moderately likely over the coming century, is that rising heat in the upper ocean could result in reduced oxygen in the deep. The worst-case scenario would be the creation of huge zones with too little oxygen for sea creatures to survive, with unknown consequences for the overall ecology of the ocean. It considered the possibility that a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, believed to be especially vulnerable to a warming ocean, would greatly increase the rate of sea level rise. It found that risk, in the near term, to be “unknown but probably low.” The National Research Council is a nonprofit group in Washington that frequently oversees studies on major scientific questions; this study was commissioned by several government agencies.	0
One-time factors in China, including the opening of several large new dams to supply electricity, played a substantial role, as did slower economic growth there. The new figures were released late Monday by the Global Carbon Project, which tracks emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and the production of cement rose by 2.1 percent in 2012, compared with 2011, and they are projected to rise by a similar amount in 2013. Since 2000, growth in such emissions had been running above 3 percent a year, on average. Scientists said that more aggressive climate policies in some countries may have played some role in the slowdown.	1
Abbott.) Opposition to the carbon tax trailed away after Ms. Gillard’s ouster, and public concern about climate change has only grown. There should be carbon pricing for major emitters. We did, after all, elect a government that promised to ax it. So we’re a hot mess of contradictions.	0
This is where forest offsets can make a real difference. Allowing them to be traded would give carbon reserves tangible value that could be sold for real money, which could be used to protect these biologically diverse forests. Saving a tropical forest of, say, a million acres would prevent roughly 367 million tons of carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere, where some of it would remain for thousands of years. In our pilot project, a major corporation has agreed to buy one million offset credits over 20 years. All of the money will underwrite a trust fund to manage and protect the forest and help local communities develop sustainable livelihoods such as eco-tourism, fish farming and beekeeping.	0

The plan doesn’t merely argue that clean energy can create good-paying jobs (which it can). It includes a needlessly long wish list of progressive economic policies, including “economic security for all people” and the counteracting of “systemic injustices.” “The operating principle behind the Green New Deal is a no-enemies-to-the-left spirit of fostering unity among every faction of the progressive movement,” Jonathan Chait writes in New York magazine. Thus, at the same time, the plan avoids taking stances that are absolutely vital to reduce carbon emissions. But it’s not. It’s more akin to a gadfly.	1
A better record has been achieved within the United States by the Endangered Species Act of 1973, which has brought 10 times more species back to health than have been lost in the same time period to extinction. All this is progress, but the prospects for the rest of the century remain grim. The global conservation movement is like a surgeon in an emergency room treating an accident victim. Congratulations, we might say — even though the patient will be dead by morning. Unless we wish to pauperize the natural world drastically and permanently, believing that later generations will be smart enough to find a way to bring equilibrium to the land, seas and air, then we, the current inheritors of this beautiful world, must take more serious action to preserve the rest of life.	2
Agricultural practices that promote carbon sequestration can be “stacked,” says Moyer, so the idea now is to combine them into one farming system for the best results. Rodale researchers say stacking no-till farming, organic farming, and composting has the potential to sequester 3,000 pounds of carbon per acre per year, ten times the amount typically achieved through no-till farming alone. Agriculture can help fight global warming. “Can it help mitigate? Yes,” he says.	0
“When we pick up the ball and run with it here in North Carolina, we’re well aware of what’s going on in Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island,” he said. “The fight we’re doing here, it bears on what happens elsewhere — we’re all in this together, we feel like.” The movement extends well beyond the United States. Climate change can be blunted only by moving to renewable energy and capping any growth of fossil fuels. Speaking to the crowd at Seneca Lake, Mr. McKibben, who had come from his home in Vermont, said, “Our job on behalf of the planet is to slow them down.” He added, “If we can hold them off for two or three years, there’s no way any of this stuff can be built again.” But the issues are not so clear cut. The protests aimed at natural gas pipelines, for example, may conflict with policies intended to fight climate change and pollution by reducing reliance on dirtier fossil fuels.	0

did not respond to questions about the administrator’s plans. Climate change activists said they expected to see Trump administration officials championing fossil fuels at the climate conference, an unwelcome position among the thousands of delegates and observers who say the world must move away from polluting sources of energy. The presence of Mr. Pruitt, who says he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming, would be particularly provocative. “The message would be, ‘We don’t care.’ The world would see an E.P.A. administrator who doesn’t even believe climate change is real,” said Carol Browner, who led the agency under Bill Clinton.	1
However, the permeability of the lower level is so low that the water table does not drop much within it, he says. Boufadel says the study points out the susceptibility of beaches worldwide to long-term oil contamination, especially at higher latitudes where beaches tend to be gravel or a mixture of sand and gravel. As global warming is melting the ice cover and exposing the Arctic to oil exploitation and shipping through sea routes such as the Northwest Passage, the risk of oil spills on gravel beaches in high-latitude regions will be increased. Boufadel and his team dug about 70 pits between 3-feet and 5-feet deep on six beaches during summers from 2007 to 2009. His report focuses on data collected on Eleanor Island, about 15 miles away from Bligh Reef where the Exxon Valdez grounded on March 24, 1989.	0
Park officials are already looking to invest more money and effort to research and monitor the changes. The idea, says Jonathan Jarvis, regional director, Pacific West Region of the National Park Service, is that the parks may serve as the proverbial “canaries in the coal mine” – predictors of things to come for other populations and ecosystems. As a result of climate change, national parks are seeing extended fire seasons, species migration, and increased snow melt. Researchers and park officers outlined some of their concerns this week to a congressional subcommittee at a special hearing on the “Impacts of Climate Change on America’s National Parks” here in Twentynine Palms, Calif. M. Rebecca Shaw, director of conservation for the Nature Conservancy of California, told the panel, “An explosion of studies in the last five years has documented observed climate impacts on species distributions, wildfire frequency and intensity, pest outbreaks, and sea-level rise.” “Keeping wildlife populations, rivers, forests, deserts, and our national parks healthy will allow us to support nearly 6.5 million existing jobs and continue to generate $88 billion in state and national tax revenue,” Cipra told the panel, pointing to a 2006 study by the Outdoor Industry Association, which found that fishing, hunting, hiking, and other outdoor pursuits contribute $730 billion annually to the US economy. The congressional subcommittee also heard from John Coleman, founder of The Weather Channel, who denies that global warming exists.	0
"The aquifer is tapped to irrigate corn, soybeans, wheat and other crops, sustain cattle and other livestock, and for drinking water for millions of people throughout the region. The researchers said current water policies have not translated to significant reductions in use of the groundwater - people are simply pumping until wells run dry. Balancing the water needs of the present with the long-term needs of the future is a global concern. ""Although consumption of freshwater supplies has not yet crossed a potentially dangerous planetary threshold, crop yields have begun to fall in many regions because of water scarcity, and global food security remains a worldwide concern,"" the report said. ""There is a clear need for society to become prepared for the consequences of reductions in groundwater use that shall occur in the foreseeable future."""	0
We might be looking at, oh, 80 or 100 feet of sea-level rise in the long haul, a direct result of the failures of this generation to get emissions under control. What kind of shape do you think Miami – or for that matter, New York – is likely to be in after 80 feet of sea-level rise? The single biggest uncertainty in climate science has nothing to do with the physics of the atmosphere, or the stability of the ice, or anything like that. The great uncertainty is, and has always been, how much carbon pollution humans are going to choose to pump into the air. In fact, calculations have been run on this.	1
"Hardier hybrids could also help. While cranberry hybrid development has thus far been focused on improving fruit yield, nutrition, and color, Carolyn DeMoranville, director of the UMass Cranberry Station, says more attention will need to be put on developing disease- and drought-resistant types. These solutions may not help with global warming's long-term effects. But presuming that somebody decides to finally start doing something about climate change, then I think we would still have the tools ... to deal with the amount of change that's predicted in the less-drastic models."" Meanwhile, some growers worry that their once-ideal growing zones are relocating north."	0
But there were big differences between hemispheres in this and other glacial periods. The effects of ice ages in the Northern Hemisphere are more extensive because it is “land-dominated, with lots of continents, whereas the south is mostly ocean,” Dr. Schaefer said. The rhythm of ice ages parallels changes in the solar energy that heats the continents. The last ice age peaked about 20,000 years ago, when solar radiation in the north was at a minimum because of complex factors related to Earth’s orbit. The dominant difference between interglacial periods, as we have now, and ice ages is the waxing and waning Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, most prominently the Laurentide ice sheet that covered most of North America in the last ice age, Dr. Schaefer said.	1
But with melting ice opening up northern shipping lanes and access to vast troves of oil, gas and minerals — and with Russia increasingly alienated from the other members on the council and assertive in its claims to the far north — the past weekend’s council meeting in the far-northern Canadian city of Iqaluit sometimes seemed as frigid as the outside air. At the meeting, the United States assumed the rotating two-year chairmanship of the Arctic Council, whose other members are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden as well as six indigenous groups of the far north. Protecting the delicate Arctic environment from the consequences of climate change will be a top American priority over the next two years. As important a task will be to prevent the clash with Russia over Ukraine from undermining the cooperation on which the council has operated for the past 20 years. Russia has steadily increased its military presence in the far north.	0
“This is the real question, not if Democrats are going to get elected, not if Republicans are going to get elected, but if America is going to be America, she’s going to have to address systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and militarism, and our false moral narrative of religious nationalism,” he said. Mr. Gore, well known for his work on global warming, said the issues of coal pollution and climate change were linked. Both are necessary byproducts of our addiction to fossil fuels. The two men visited Belews Creek, a predominantly black community in a predominantly white county that resides in the shadow of the Belews Creek Steam Station, a coal-fired power plant.

He has been sharply critical of Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. But with his foray into SSTs, he risks sullying his reputation. We can emit only so much carbon dioxide and still remain within the temperature limit set by the Paris accord. New supersonic aircraft will help devour that carbon budget faster than ever. These aircraft will also pollute our skies and, with their sonic booms, break the calm we all need.	1
To conduct the analysis, the researchers compared well information from the US Energy Information Agency and state environmental and natural resource agencies to data collected by the services DrillingInfo and the FracFocus Chemical Disclosure Registry. The data set covered six years and more than 12,000 individual wells. Rising fossil fuel emissions, which increase the temperature of the planet, pose grave risks to water supplies. Water levels in 21 of the world’s 47 largest known aquifers are trending negative, according to a 2015 study published by a group of NASA scientists in the journal Water Resources Research. Another NASA study, published in the journal Nature in May, found that California alone lost four gigatons of water from 2007 to 2015.	0
The government will take its goal to the United Nations climate change conference, to be held in Paris in November and December. “At 26 to 28 percent, Australia’s target gets the right balance between our economic and environmental responsibilities,” Mr. Abbott said Tuesday after meeting with lawmakers. We are committed to tackling climate change without a carbon tax or an emissions-trading scheme that will hike up power bills for families, pensioners and businesses. Mr. Abbott has told Australian voters that measures like a pollution tax or a carbon-trading program would result in higher electricity prices and reduced economic growth. “There are many additional ways we can reduce emissions, while saving businesses and households money and lifting productivity,” he said Tuesday.	0
By Lisa Friedman The Trump administration has blown past a Jan. 1 deadline to update the United Nations on America’s progress toward cutting planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for the consequences of climate change. Tardiness in submitting the two reports — one is required every two years under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty signed by President George Bush; the other every four years — is not unheard-of. The missed deadline underscores the disdain with which the Trump administration views the worldwide effort to rein in global warming. They also argue it undermines the United States’ push for transparency in countries like China. “No matter their differences, previous administrations agreed on at least one thing: Countries must be transparent about their emissions, as well as their actions to address climate pollution, and should report on these issues regularly and comprehensively,” Nathan Hultman and Paul Bodnar, two Obama administration climate change officials, wrote in a recent op-ed in The Hill.	0
Despite decades of deforestation and environmental damage, a recent study published in Nature Climate Change found that, lately, the Earth has been getting a bit greener. Between 2003 and 2012, the amount of vegetation above ground increased by 4 billion metric tons of carbon. The new vegetation was mapped over a period of two decades using a method called passive microwave remote sensing, in which satellites measure radiofrequency radiation emitted from the Earth. Just about everything emits a small amounts of electromagnetic radiation in the same frequencies as radio waves, and these emissions carry information about the temperature and moisture content of the object emitting it.	1
In recent years, global climate talks have focused on trying to hold human-triggered warming to 2 degrees C by the end of the century. The study implies that even that goal would be too warm for winter snows to make up for summer melt for one of the planet's two major land-topping ice sheets. The rate of ice loss expected for warming of 1.6 degrees is slow, occurring over 50,000 years. Higher climate-change temperatures would accelerate the process. The ice sheet could lose 20 percent of its mass over the next 500 years from temperature increases associated with so-called business-as-usual greenhouse-gas emissions through century's end.	2
Mr. Koch and his colleagues acknowledged those other factors, which they say accounted for about half of the decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. But the other half, they argued, could be accounted for only by a large increase in vegetation caused by the effects of colonization. The deaths caused by colonization led to a drop of about 3.5 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That finding can be instructive, Ms. Perren said. It not only reinforces that human activity can affect the climate, but it also shows that there are natural ways to address the modern global warming problem.	1
Several hours later, Mr. Obama arrived in Hawaii, where he addressed leaders of Pacific Island nations, several of whom face the prospect of rising seas swallowing their homes and native lands. “Few people understand the stakes better than our Pacific Island leaders, because they’re already seeing the impact,” Mr. Obama said at the East-West Center, an education and research organization in Honolulu. Rising seas had driven villagers from their homes in Fiji and led Kiribati to buy property elsewhere for the day when that country vanishes beneath the waves. Mr. Obama repeated his criticism of those who deny the science of climate change. But he has sought to reframe the debate over climate change around issues like conservation and environmental protection, officials said, because they are more accessible than scientific discussions of carbon emissions — and perhaps less polarizing, too.	1
Without apparent irony, the E & E News article goes on to compare the United States’s environmental record unfavorably with that of North Korea: North Korea — whose carbon emissions rank in the bottom half of nations worldwide — put forward a hefty commitment to cut its greenhouse gases 37.4 percent compared with 1990 levels. And as Trump was pulling the United States out of the agreement last June, Kim described Trump’s decision as “the height of egotism.’ Yes. The secret of being green is to have zero economic growth: no manufacturing no pesky carbon emissions. This is why, during Earth Hour, when the world’s nations turn off their lights for an hour in sympathy with Gaia, the hands down winner every time is North Korea. That’s because in North Korea, the Earth Hour blackout operates pretty much 24/7 365 days a year.	2
Perhaps all we can do is manage loss.” David Luchsinger was in charge of the Statue of Liberty for the National Park Service when Hurricane Sandy ravaged Liberty Island in 2012, and he led the team that brought the park back to life on July 4 the following year. Mr. Luchsinger, retired and living in New Hampshire, said the issue with historic sites was not just finding the money to make them more resilient, but also slowing the emissions that are putting them at risk in the first place. To turn a blind eye on how sea-level rise and climate change are going to affect preserving our history is just, to me, unacceptable. “That’s where we come from. That is who we are.”	0
“The jury is definitely still out on that,” Dr. Stammerjohn said. Whatever the explanation, much of the Bellingshausen is now ice free for long periods each summer. The relatively warmer waters of the Southern Ocean to flow more freely to the more permanent ice that extends from the land in glaciers and sheets. “The combination of the warm ocean and the effects of waves on these glaciers may increase the rate of loss of glacial ice,” Dr. Maksym said. The consensus now is that there is a net loss of ice from Antarctica’s ice sheets and glaciers, Dr. Maksym added, and it is the melting of this ice, rather than any loss of sea ice, that concerns scientists who study sea-level increases.	1
"On their own, each of these techniques held uncertainties; certain factors such as variable snowfall on top of the ice or changes in the rock underneath it could affect the satellite measurements. By looking at all these types of measurements together, the study authors could more confidently set aside data that did not represent ice cover, Shepherd explained. The satellite measurements tell us that the ice sheet is much more dynamic than we used to think. ""If you take a look at the first IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] assessment report — 30 years ago, before we had satellite measurements of the polar regions — you&apos;ll see that the ice sheets were not expected to respond to climate change at all. The general consensus in glaciology was that ice sheets couldn&apos;t change rapidly — but that&apos;s not the case,"" Shepherd said."	1
The latest paper explores the environmental consequences of interconnected economies. The scientists wrote that “outsourcing production to China does not always relieve consumers in the United States — or for that matter many countries in the Northern Hemisphere — from the environmental impacts of air pollution.” The movement of air pollutants associated with the production of goods in China for the American market has resulted in a decline in air quality in the Western United States, the scientists wrote, though less manufacturing in the United States does mean cleaner air in the American East. He and the other scientists wanted to examine the transborder effects of emissions from export industries to look at how consumption contributes to global air pollution. “We’re focusing on the trade impact,” said Mr. Lin, a professor in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at Peking University’s School of Physics. “Trade changes the location of production and thus affects emissions.” Powerful global winds called westerlies can carry pollutants from China across the Pacific within days, leading to “dangerous spikes in contaminants,” especially during the spring, according to a news release from the University of California, Irvine, where one of the study’s co-authors, Steven J. Davis, is an earth system scientist.	1
We are concerned that the vital role of science education institutions will be eroded by a loss of public trust if museums are associated with individuals and organizations known for rejecting climate science, opposing environmental regulation and clean energy initiatives, and blocking efforts to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases. Pretty soon, though, it shows its true colors: Rebekah Mercer and the Mercer Family Foundation, political kingmakers and the financiers behind Breitbart News, are major funders of climate science denial projects such as the Heartland Institute, where they have donated nearly $6 million since 2008. An increase in C02 emissions from fossil fuels will be a great benefit to plant and animal life on Earth. Yup. Like I said this has nothing to do with science, let alone with concern for the integrity of the AMNH.	2
As the world’s top scientists meet in Yokohama, Japan, this week, at the top of the agenda is the prediction that global sea levels could rise more than three feet by 2100. Higher seas and warmer weather will cause profound changes. Widespread burning of fossil fuels is releasing heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet. While this will produce a host of effects, the most worrisome may be the melting of much of the earth’s ice, which is likely to raise sea levels and flood coastal regions. Such a rise will be uneven because of gravitational effects and human intervention, so predicting its outcome in any one place is difficult.	0
"In a study published in 2012, they noted that even in the absence of global warming, damage from tropical cyclones could top $56 billion a year by the end of the century, up from about $26 billion today, as a result of population growth and increasing wealth gathered along coasts in storm-prone basins. Add global warming to the mix, and the annual damage estimate from tropical cyclones could rise by another $53 billion. No single storm can be laid at the foot of global warming. But the typhoon Haiyan disaster should serve as a wake-up call, according to the Philippines climate negotiator Naderev Saño: ""I speak for my delegation, but I speak for the countless people who will no longer be able to speak for themselves after perishing from the storm. I speak also for those who have been orphaned by the storm."	2
The ancient world, like our own, was interdependent and suffered a “domino” fall, Dr. Cline added. Gavin A. Schmidt, the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA, said that in some ways, modern civilization had not advanced much in its coping mechanisms for climate crises. If the sea is rising, you either get out of the way, or you get flooded. But, he added, modern humans possess much better predictive power and are therefore “the first generation who is able to take mitigation seriously.” Yet many countries are still behind on goals set as part of the 2015 Paris climate agreement. “This is the tragedy,” said John F. Haldon, a historian at Princeton University who studies how ancient civilizations coped with climatic upheaval.	1
"""This is the first time that we've seen it in these southeast glacial fjords."" In July, the world's oceans were the warmest in almost 130 years of record-keeping. A combination of factors are at work, including a natural El Nino system, man-made global warming and a dash of random weather. Coinciding with the shrinking of sea ice on the North Pole and the thawing of the Arctic permafrost, the discovery of Greenland's runaway glaciers earlier this decade raised a sense of urgency among scientists studying the impact of climate change on the frozen north. It has also been used by advocacy groups like Greenpeace to stress the importance of reaching a deal in Copenhagen to limit global greenhouse emissions."	2
"All of these things are consistent with the general warming of the climate,"" Xie said. ""Yet, if you plot the global temperature, you see a flattening average over the last 15 years. Carbon dioxide is causing the general rise of global temperatures. Xie and his colleagues set out to solve this mystery using climate models to reproduce the long- and short-term trends based on global climate records from the past 130 years. The researchers found that sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, in spite of anthropogenic or manmade effects of global warming, were key ingredients in creating the flattening global temperatures seen in the past 15 years."	1
Maybe the kids are pining for the days when sex was guilt-free, drugs were cheap, and rock 'n roll ruled. Or maybe they've been watching History Channel documentaries about the protests of that era that make it seem fun and cool to get arrested.

If they ever grow up, they will realize that what they are asking is impossible without destroying industrialized civilization.	2
Regarding climate change, the U.N. General Secretary said he is “disappointed with the results of COP25, which just concluded in Madrid,” because the international community “lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis.” “We must not give up and I will not give up,” he said. “I’m more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5-degree temperature rise.” “The climate crisis is a race against time for the survival of our civilization,” he added. While many people already face the dire consequences of the climate crisis, the reality of an environment that is becoming uninhabitable is still not obvious to everyone. “But we can still reverse the trends. Solutions exist.” Mr. Guterres also underscored his conviction that the way forward involves a move away from nationalism toward a more multilateral international society.	0
"socialism), and crime than they have to do with climate change, however. While many liberal outlets rushed to blame climate change for the Syrian Civil War, Syrian-American M. Zuhdi Jasser, founder and president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, powerfully shot down that idea in a 2017 interview with PJ Media. Anyone who believes that climate change had anything to do with any of the conflict in Syria is a fool. He insisted that boiling the war down to a drought ostensibly caused by carbon emissions would be ""a disservice to every life lost in Syria."" Jasser noted that the Syrian revolution started in Daraa, a small rural town in southern Syria a stone's throw from the Sea of Galilee."	2
War is becoming an outdated means of human conflict resolution. Technology is turning armed conflict into an endeavor increasingly dominated by what war scholars call “asymmetric warfare” — meaning that weaker powers like Iran can now marshal so much strength that they are no longer very weak, exacting a mighty cost of victory even to the world’s pre-eminent global superpower. Then there is climate change, which has ratcheted up the opportunity cost of every conflict. You may debate whether any particular historical war worked out well for its agitators. But there should be no debate that many of America’s recent wars have ended in misery for all.	2
Combustion of natural gas emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal and 30 percent less than oil, and its expansion is widely credited for helping the United States curb emissions in the past decade. It also produces methane, a fast-acting greenhouse gas with enormous short-term impacts on the climate. The world needs to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, and must eliminate them by 2050 to limit warming to relatively safe levels. To do that, the United States would need to phase out all fossil fuels, including gas, as rapidly as possible. Mr. Kasich said in an interview that he believed in finding a consensus among Americans to tackle climate change, and saw a solution in both putting a price on carbon and increasing the research, development and deployment of renewable energy.	0
Environmental concerns such as rising sea levels are contributing decisively to international armed conflicts and must be addressed with urgency. The Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the U.N., Archbishop Bernardito Auza, cited reports making the remarkable claim that “in the last 60 years, at least forty percent of all inter-state conflicts can be associated with natural resources.” “Not only that exploitation of high-value resources — like timber and precious minerals, or scarce ones like fertile land and water — provoke conflicts,” the archbishop said, but “conflicts, in turn, put immense pressure on those treasured natural resources, as they are exploited as means in waging conflicts.” “In other words, we fight over the ever-more scarce resources of our planet, and exploit the same resources to continue our fights,” he said. The Vatican, led by Pope Francis, has made environmental concern a key prism through which to view other social and ethical issues.	0

Is really led by grown-up global warming zealots. The court, one that has been reliably liberal before President Donald Trump became president with the power to appoint judges, did express reluctance, but cited the separation of powers’ role in the ruling: We reluctantly conclude, however, that the plaintiffs’ case must be made to the political branches or to the electorate at large, the latter of which can change the composition of the political branches through the ballot box. That the other branches may have abdicated their responsibility to remediate the problem does not confer on Article III courts, no matter how well-intentioned, the ability to step into their shoes.	2
"This upcoming winter may be warmer overall, but government forecasters are advising that there may be some ""large swings"" due to volatile weather patterns. Warmer-than-average temperatures are forecast for much of the U.S. this winter, with a wetter-than-normal season from December through February across the northern parts of the country. ""No part of the U.S. is favored to have below-average temperatures this winter,"" according to the outlook. But forecasters admitted Thursday that global climate patterns that typically influence winter weather patterns are weak this year, leading to complicated forecasts."	1

Refined and burned as gasoline or jet fuel, it will spew carbon into the air, raising the temperature of the planet. The victims of climate change are primarily people who have done little to cause the crisis. Cyclones, floods and fires are now displacing three times as many people as wars.

___ 12:30 p.m. The president of the European Union’s executive says the bloc’s move toward a climate neutral continent by 2050 will force its trading partners to put in extra effort if they want to do business with the EU. There is no point in only reducing greenhouse gas emissions at home, if we increase the import of CO2 from abroad. It is not only a climate issue; it is also an issue of fairness.” Von der Leyen wants to avoid a situation where EU countries reduce emissions as part of their ambition to make the continent carbon neutral by 2050, but at the same time import CO2 imbedded in goods. She said in its attempt to pursue a cleaner and climate neutral economy, the EU also needs to protect its industries and workers.	0
In a recent commentary in the journal Nature, scientists from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and other institutions warned that the acceleration of ice loss and other effects of climate change have brought the world “dangerously close” to abrupt and irreversible changes, or tipping points. Among these, the researchers said, were the collapse of at least part of the West Antarctic ice sheet — which itself could eventually raise sea levels by four feet or more — or the loss of the Amazon rainforest. In our view, the consideration of tipping points helps to define that we are in a climate emergency. The societal toll is accelerating, too, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said in Madrid before the opening this week of the U.N.’s annual climate conference. “Climate-related natural disasters are becoming more frequent, more deadly, more destructive, with growing human and financial costs,” he said.	0
I felt rather powerful when I realized that I had survived the repeal of net neutrality. When Trump’s tax cuts didn’t kill me like the Dems said they would, I began feeling almost immortal.

The reality is that we live in an extraordinary time of abundance that we should be celebrating. The average middle class American of 2020 enjoys more luxury on a daily basis than the wealthiest 19th Century Americans did.	2
“Climate change poses unprecedented challenges to human societies, and our community of central banks and supervisors cannot consider itself immune to the risks ahead of us,” François Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Banque de France, said in the report. Central banks spent much of the last 10 years hauling their economies out of a deep financial crisis that began in 2008. They may well spend the next decade coping with the disruptive effects of climate change and technology. The European Central Bank, which on Thursday concluded a two-day meeting in Frankfurt focusing on monetary policy, is beginning to grapple with those challenges. The bank did not make any changes in interest rates or its economic stimulus program on Thursday.	0

Then, in the early 1990s, scientists completed more precise studies of ice cores extracted from the Greenland ice sheet. Dust and oxygen isotopes encased in the cores provided a detailed climate record going back eons. There had been 25 rapid climate change events like the Younger Dryas in the last glacial period. The evidence in those ice cores would prove pivotal in turning the conventional wisdom. As the science historian Spencer Weart put it: “How abrupt was the discovery of abrupt climate change?	1
While climate refers to the long-term averages and trends in atmospheric conditions over large areas, weather deals with short-term variations, which is what happens when Arctic air visits your hometown. And, of course, an Arctic blast can still occur in a warmer world, even if the air that comes down from the north is not as cold. Climate change could actually make frigid waves of Arctic air more common, a result of shrinking sea ice. Unlike in the rest of the country, above-average temperatures were expected across the West into the Great Basin and Rockies. For Southern California and the Southwest, warmer temperatures, relatively low humidity and a lack of rain mean an elevated threat of fires.	0
The administration has particularly challenged scientific findings related to the environment and public health opposed by industries such as oil drilling and coal mining. It has also impeded research around human-caused climate change, which President Trump has dismissed despite a global scientific consensus. But the erosion of science reaches well beyond the environment and climate. In Washington, D.C., a scientific committee that provided expertise in defending against invasive insects has been disbanded. In Kansas City, Mo., the hasty relocation of two agricultural agencies that fund crop science and study the economics of farming has led to an exodus of employees and delayed hundreds of millions of dollars in research.	2

The council’s bipartisan carbon dividends plan calls for a national carbon fee starting at $40 per ton and increasing at 5 percent per year above inflation. This would establish the highest carbon price of any major emitting country. The United States to exceed its 2025 commitment under the Paris Climate Agreement by a wide margin. The plan’s environmental ambition is matched by equally strong pro-consumer, pro-business and pro-competitiveness provisions. Specifically, its other pillars include returning all the revenue directly to the American people (a family of four would receive about $2,000 a year), adjustments for carbon-intensive imports and exports to level the economic playing field, and regulatory simplification.	1
That's how they've always done it, and they'll keep doing so as long as it keeps working. But thanks for this Kinsley gaffe, Senator Hirono. Climate change is a cult. You told us the truth, if only for a second, and we'll remember it. Because you'd rather we didn't.	2
The percentage of each is CH4 (0.36 percent), carbon dioxide (CO2) (4 percent), and water vapor (H2O) (95 percent). The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), charged with considering only human causes of warming, say that humans add H2O, but the amount is so small relative to the atmospheric total that they don’t consider it significant. A 2 percent variation in H2O equals any climate change effect of human-produced CO2, or indeed all CH4, whether from natural or human sources. Our inability to solve all problems requires that policymakers create a priorities list. AOC made the list for the GND.	1
Only 53 percent of the 43 House Republican seats that were occupied by members of the bipartisan congressional Climate Solutions Caucus remained in Republican hands. In contrast, almost 90 percent of the seats held by House Republicans who did not belong to the caucus remained Republican after the election. Republicans need to appeal to young people who support the climate scare. Marc Morano, publisher of the influential Washington DC-based Climatedepot.com, responded, “I can’t imagine that any millennial who cares about this is going to be voting Republican because they are activists at their core. If you’re a millennial and you’re skipping school and all excited about the Green New Deal (GND), there is no way Republicans can appeal to them with some sort of lite version of the GND.” “You don't capitulate to young voters because they have been brainwashed into believing that mankind is driving a climate 'crisis,'” said Morano.	2
The notion that we only have twelve years to fix the planet before the world ends has become the latest doomsday prediction to be popularized by the left. This prediction comes from The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its 2018 UN Special Report on Global warming of 1.5ºC. This is the same body that used altered climate data in order to push their own agenda. The Paris Climate Agreement was seen as the latest global effort to do something about climate change. When President Trump got us out of the illegal treaty, the left chastised him as someone who was dooming the planet.	1
“Like many of the world’s worst climate impacts, extreme water temperatures along the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf is directly connected to melting glaciers,” the article states, and the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has “triggered a slowing of ocean currents that routinely circulate cooler water into New England.” “It’s left the Gulf of Maine with a warming level at almost four times the global ocean average,” Gray asserts. Nonetheless, Maine has seen record lobster harvests in recent years, Gray notes, at “132 million pounds of lobster landings in 2016 as opposed to 57 million pounds of lobster in 2000,” though she insists that “Maine’s boom is not likely to last.” As interesting as Ms. Gray’s findings and predictions are, she fails to establish a causal relationship between manmade global warming and the meteorological phenomena she cites. Temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula had been falling steadily for the last 18 years at the rate of nearly one degree Fahrenheit per decade, countering earlier warming trends and completely undermining one of the most cited cases of rapid climate change. Writing in Nature, the scientists acknowledged that what was once considered one of the most remarkable cases of accelerated anthropogenic climate warming was not due to human causes at all but rather to natural climate swings. The scientists observed that despite volumes of literature to the contrary, “both the warming since the 1950s and the cooling since the late 1990s are entirely consistent with natural climate variability.” Follow @tdwilliamsrome	2
Greenhouse gas emissions are still rising dangerously. “The summary findings are bleak,” said the annual assessment, which is produced by the United Nations Environment Program and is formally known as the Emissions Gap Report.

Following another year of extreme heat and ice sheet melt, environmental issues are now considered to be the top five long-term risks confronting the global economy. Citing a survey of more than 750 key decision-makers, the World Economic Forum said catastrophic trends like global warming and the extinction of animal species would be front and center at next week's meeting. But while the environment has surged up the rank of priorities for policymakers ahead of risks like cyberattacks and recession, concerns are compounded by growing international divisions, evident in disputes like the trade war between the United States and China.	0
We must all face the harsh reality that our planet is rapidly approaching an irreversible tipping point, beyond which the unraveling of our ecosystems will be beyond our control. Scientists have made clear that we now have less than 11 years to reduce fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions roughly by half, and 20 years after that to cut them to net zero, to stabilize the rise in temperatures by the end of the century and meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change. We are the last generation that can prevent an unthinkable global catastrophe. There are many things we can all do. We can join protests, engage in civil disobedience and risk arrest, but we must also see this as the uniquely critical political moment it is.	0
"The court correctly understood that a lawsuit aimed at imposing a national plan to eliminate fossil fuel emissions and reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide would push the court far beyond its constitutional powers,"" Sam Kazman, general counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), said in a statement. ""It would require the court to substitute its judgment for that of Congress and the Administration on an unprecedented scale."" However, it is unfortunate that, in coming to this conclusion, the court summarized the scientific evidence on climate change in such apocalyptic terms. ""The Department of Justice should have made clear that its failure to contest this evidence did not mean that the evidence was incontestable. Hopefully, future litigation on this issue will involve a more measured assessment of climate reality."""	2
The U.N. Human Rights Committee published its ruling Tuesday in the case of a man from Kiribati who was sent back to the Pacific island nation after being denied asylum by New Zealand in 2015. The Geneva-based panel, which monitors states' compliance with the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, concluded that although the deportation was legal, similar cases might in future justify asylum claims. Their rights are endangered by the impacts of climate change. The plaintiff in the case, Ioane Teitiota, had argued that he and his family were threatened by the lack of fresh water and violent land disputes as the ocean encroaches on Kiribati. The panel concluded that he had failed to provide sufficient evidence for his claims and that while Kiribati is likely to become uninhabitable, there is still a chance the island's government might avert this.	0
“We’ve seen these incidents becoming larger and more intense,” said Leighton Drury, a fire union official in New South Wales. “It would be very silly for any politician or any leader to keep their head in the ground and say we don’t need to do anything here.” Nonetheless, for now, that is what the government is doing. Now is not the time to discuss climate policy or politics. Photographed hugging fire victims, he has sought to focus on emotional and financial support. Joëlle Gergis, a climate scientist and author, said that “it wastes the opportunity to explain to the Australian public what we’re seeing in climate extremes.” Unfortunately, more opportunities are on the way.	2
But scientists have found that climate change — including longer, hotter and drier fire seasons, diminishing snowpack and lengthening droughts — have already measurably worsened the size and scale of fires in the western United States. Hotter temperatures means drier vegetation, making it more likely to burn. If greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels continue to increase at current rates, the frequency of severe fires in the west could triple. The report noted that climate change will also bring more specific threats to California. Increased drought could devastate the state’s farmers, warming waters could close fisheries and spur the growth of toxic algae, and rising seas could inundate the homes of 200,000 Californians and erode two-thirds of California beaches by 2100.	0
Canada is generally seen as being good at forest management. In logged areas of the boreal forest, trees are replanted and allowed to regenerate, and the country boasts a very low official deforestation rate of just 0.02 percent (though that has been disputed by some environmental groups). The bad news is, even if actual deforestation is low, planting a young tree to replace a mature one is not the one-for-one carbon scenario many people imagine. For a long time, scientists believed older trees stopped absorbing carbon as they aged. But recently, researchers have that found older trees continue absorbing carbon dioxide for decades or even centuries longer than originally thought, said William Moomaw, a physical chemist and lead author on five Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.	1
“Australia is experiencing a climate emergency. It is literally burning,” he says, before suggesting that it is time to vote in woke leaders who embrace the dogmas of the climate crisis. Australians must vote out fossil-fuelled politicians who have chosen to be part of the problem and vote in climate champions who are willing to solve it. Mann may have missed the 2018 World Air Quality Report, published by IQAIR, which ranks the world’s nations by the cleanliness of their air, according to estimated average PM2.5 concentration (μg/m³). Had he read the report, he would have found a curious fact: by and large, the cleanest air is found in first-world nations that have benefited from the cheap, available energy that he deplores.	0
“We understand the reality of climate change, but you still need to invest in energy stocks, so why don’t you invest in the most forward-looking company?” he said. “We don’t believe it has to be an overnight change. The economic consequences of cutting carbon too quickly will outweigh the short-term benefit to the environment. Not surprisingly, some investors don’t want to get caught in the transition from old methods to new ones. Chat Reynders, a co-founder and the chief executive of Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, which manages about $2 billion, falls into this category.	2
In January, he promised to introduce what he considered to be an “achievable” version of the Green New Deal, praising the concept of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s version but calling it “pie in the sky.” His version ended up being a project called Beyond Carbon, which aims to eliminate coal-fired power plants by 2030, stop the growth of natural gas and transition the United States to renewable energy sources. The project — to which Mr. Bloomberg has pledged $500 million — follows the same model as the Beyond Coal campaign that he and the Sierra Club started in 2011, which he says contributed to the closing of more than half of the country’s coal-fired power plants. The solution to climate change might not come through government action. The Green New Deal “stands no chance of passage in the Senate over the next two years,” he wrote, “but Mother Nature does not wait on our political calendar, and neither can we.” On taxes, health care and other economic issues, Mr. Bloomberg would be very much on the conservative end of the Democratic field. He argued in January that a tax on the wealth of rich Americans would be unconstitutional because “the Constitution lets you impose income taxes only.” That alone doesn’t distinguish him too much — only a handful of candidates have endorsed a wealth tax — but he has also criticized other types of tax increases on the wealthy.	1
Climate activists say Germany could do more to achieve its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 55% of their 1990 level by 2030 were it not for the government's strong ties to the car industry, which supports some 800,000 jobs. They point to government resistance to introducing a speed limit on all of German motorways. The lack of such a limit on large sections of the network encourages drivers to race unashamedly and emit more carbon dioxide.

“The mean maximum temperature for December was less than 20 degrees Celsius only in 1919, 1929, 1961 and 1997,” stated an official from the India Meteorological Department. “In December this year, the mean maximum temperature (MMT) till Thursday was 19.85 degrees Celsius. Delhi hit its coldest temperature of the season Saturday as the mercury plummeted to 2.4 degrees Celsius in the morning. The Safdarjung Observatory, whose reading is considered the official marking for the city, registered Saturday’s record low. On Sunday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a “code red” warning because of cold wave conditions in Delhi, Haryana, and other neighboring states.	1
Climate change spending has been the biggest waste of taxpayer money in 2019. The Taxpayers’ Association released the results of their annual wasteful spending poll earlier this week, declaring that climate policy had been the biggest waste of money, largely due to the fact that despite the spending, emissions in Sweden had actually slightly increased. In 2014, the Swedish national government spent 5.2 billion Swedish krona (£419 million/$547 million), a number that has more than doubled to 12.6 billion krona (£1 billion/$1.3 billion) for the planned 2020 budget.	2
"""Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament,"" and glued themselves to buildings to force governments to adopt climate change policies. 'I am an actual scientist of physics, meteorology, astrophysics and climate and say Greta Thunberg is wrong and suffers mental abuse by manipulative adults.' Accepted science on man made climate change is a 'cover up' that exists to push up fuel prices. Though Piers Corbyn may not realize it is precisely because Greta Thunberg is a child that she is irrefutable. Physics, meteorology, astrophysics are incommensurable to arguments based on victimhood or innocence."	2
If we manage to stop construction, each of those people could claim credit for preventing one forty-two-thousandth of those emissions — some 876 metric tons per person! It would take 54 years of individual zero-carbon living to make the same dent. The climate crisis is not going to be solved by personal sacrifice. It will be solved by electing the right people, passing the right laws, drafting the right regulations, signing the right treaties — and respecting those treaties already signed, particularly with indigenous nations. It will be solved by holding the companies and people who have made billions off our shared atmosphere to account.	0
Brooks Hanson, executive vice president of the American Geophysical Union, which runs the conference, said in an email that the group supports remote presentations whenever possible. But the wrap-up speaker position “requires in-person interactions with attendees to get the vibe of the meeting and discussions,” Hanson said. Climate scientists and activists should walk the walk. But we can only walk so far. Then you bump into other things.”	1
"That claim was already refuted 10 years ago. Since then there have been dozens of studies from every corner of the globe where proxy data clearly show that the aforementioned optimums occurred in cycles WORLDWIDE. The global temperature was more or less constant before human CO2 emissions. Even Michael Mann no longer believes that.""

“G20 countries are collectively responsible for 78 percent of all emissions, but they are not doing enough to contain global warming within the 1.5-2 degrees Celsius temperature goals established by the Paris Agreement in 2016,” Aljazeera reported. “Emissions need to go down by 55 percent by 2030,” John Christensen, colead author of the report, said. Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions, over 7 percent each year. Environment Program’s executive director, said in the Aljazeera report. The article said: “It will take political will, yes, but the science says we can,” Anderson said.	0

This leads them to “least common denominator” conclusions, by which we mean relatively weak or anodyne claims that everyone can sign off on. Add to this a worldview that equates rationality with dispassion and it makes scientists leery of dramatic claims, even when the evidence points in their direction. Climate change has been driven by runaway human consumption, much of which is based on want (comfort, convenience, entertainment), not need. If we managed to convince many hundreds of millions of people around the world, middle and upper class, to cut way back on consumption, how quickly could this affect demand and then, hopefully, a reduction in habitat destruction, carbon dioxide generation, etc.? Oreskes: This is a tough question.	0
"""They're trying to create an alternative reality in the same way that the Nazis did and that Lenin and Stalin did and that Mao Zedong did. It's an alternate reality that doesn't work."" Climate change is not a true crisis. ""The crisis has been manufactured in order to create a huge climate-industrial complex that can command the redistribution of colossal amounts of money."" Even if the United States reduced its emissions to zero, ""it would have no impact on global warming, because Chinese emissions have gone up so rapidly."	2
"An adherence to the plain text of scripture can help Christians avoid this unfortunate fate, but ultimately the work of the Holy Spirit is necessary to prevent us from sliding into believing what we want to believe because it is popular. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, perfectly illustrates the threat of redefining Christianity to fit the zeitgeist. Not acting on climate change is a ""kind of sin,"" as though God had a political program, and that program involved handing power over to Pete Buttigieg. Buttigieg has consistently reinterpreted Christianity to support Democratic politics. The threat of syncretism is not just a liberal thing — Christians must be careful to put their trust in God before any political ideology."	0
"According to a recent Politico report, Sanders, who supports passing a Green New Deal, has spent more than $342,000 on private jet travel since 2016. According to the report, the Clinton-Kaine campaign spent about $100,000 on private jet trips for Sanders at his request during the 2016 presidential campaign. Sanders repeatedly requested and received the use of a carbon-spewing private jet for himself and his traveling staff when he served as a surrogate campaigner for Hillary Clinton.

"Finally, the Alt-GND promises new initiatives to defend ""communities — across states, territories, and tribal nations — that are preparing for and fighting against fires, floods, droughts, and hurricanes."" O'Rourke would increase pre-disaster mitigation grants ten-fold, change the law to force post-disaster construction to be stronger, manage ecosystems to defend against climate-related risks, expand federal crop insurance, train first responders for climate disasters, and strengthening military bases against climate danger. No amount of big government climate-focused reform can prevent disasters fueled by climate change. Is this a tacit acknowledgment that the entire effort is wrong-headed? Why are investments to fight climate disasters still necessary even after remaking the entire economy to prevent climate change?"	0
It’s not only the elimination of conventional energy, but it is really about the decarbonizing of the industry in Poland but also in Europe, we would deal with the liquidation of the metallurgical, steel and cement industries…What can happen in Poland if we stick to the dogma of the climate policy—we will lose about half a million jobs in the next 20 years. “I can declare that we in Poland are ready, under the auspicious of Solidarity, to actually lead to an economic, social, scientific conference on which different types of views will collide—those who say that man is responsible for climate change and the skeptical ones,” said Kolorz. Climate policy is good for humans. Let us lead a policy that is really good for the citizens of the world but let us not lead the policy that is stuffed with lies and which would really lead to the fact that the rich will be even richer and the poor will be even poorer.” This was followed by the presentation of the “Dauntless Purveyor of Climate Truth Award” to the junior author of this article, Dr. Jay Lehr, for his many years of fearless communication of climate science realities to the public. In his acceptance speech, Lehr focused on the real drivers of the climate scare—attempts by the left to impose world socialism and put society under ever more government control.	1
In the early 2000s, ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica, and scientists realized that process could greatly accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves. And some major glaciers are dumping ice directly into the ocean. An irreversible collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet had already begun, and computer modeling in 2016 indicated that its disintegration in concert with other melting could raise sea levels up to six feet by 2100, about twice the increase described as a possible worst-case scenario just three years earlier. At that pace, some of the world’s great coastal cities, including New York, London and Hong Kong, would become inundated. Then this year, a review of 40 years of satellite images suggested that the East Antarctic ice sheet, which was thought to be relatively stable, may also be shedding vast amounts of ice.	0
"The first (the first figure below) does not extrapolate temperature data over much of the African savannah (where little real data exists) and results in a global temperature anomaly of 0.88°C. The second (the second figure below), which extends over the Savanah, results in a global temperature anomaly of 0.92°C. Statistically induced warming is not real. As if that were not enough to dismiss the whole ""warmest month ever"" arguments, a quick look at the temperature data on the NOAA web site tells us that none of their grand announcements make any sense. Consider first that, according to NOAA, July 2019 set the record of the warmest month by0.03°C for combined global land and ocean surface temperature."	2
The Air Quality Index, which measures pollution, has exceeded 400 in some parts of Sydney. Readings of 100 and above are considered “poor.” “All of this is connected,” Mr. Narramore said. The heat wave could bring temperatures never before seen in Australia. The highest temperature ever recorded in the country was 123 degrees on Jan. 2, 1960, in Oodnadatta, a remote outback town in South Australia. On Wednesday, the hottest place on the continent was Birdsville, Queensland, which reached 117 degrees.	0
It’s just not physically possible. All the battery storage in the world, right now, can power New York City for one hour.” Pick highlighted the left-wing ideological foundation of the “climate change” narrative. Climate change policy is about raising capital, two trillion dollars in capital. “It’s going to move around and be redistributed under a climate change plan. That’s what it’s about.” Zero-emission nuclear energy is opposed by many Democrats, remarked Pick.	1
“It decreases more in the shoulder season,” she said. The winter months will still see significant Santa Ana activity. Precipitation patterns in California will shift with warming. So a strong Santa Ana might occur in a relatively dry December, leading to wildfires. “The window for wildfires is expanding toward winter,” Dr. Guzman-Morales said.	0
Today’s athlete has no qualms about using their sports bully pulpit to advance a political agenda. Now, ice hockey players are jumping on the “Save the Planet” bandwagon. The frightening speed of climate change is particularly visible in the Arctic. “The world today is very fragile and it’s our duty to do everything to unite people and nations to remind them that we don’t have a planet B,” Fetisov said. “Sport and environment are two spheres that will unite people and help us to protect the Earth – our common heritage.” The UN report shared a grim future for the Arctic, Based on so-called climate change models: “We simply cannot ignore the threat of climate change to the Arctic regions of our earth.	0
A separate analysis made public this month looked at how much coal, oil and natural gas the world’s nations have said they expect to produce and sell through 2030. If all those fossil fuels were ultimately extracted and burned, the report found, countries would collectively miss their climate pledges, as well as the global 2 degree Celsius target, by an even larger margin than previously thought. A number of countries around the world, including Canada and Norway, have made plans to reduce emissions at home while expanding fossil-fuel production for sale abroad. “At a global level, it doesn’t add up,” said Michael Lazarus, a lead author of the report and director of the Stockholm Environment Institute’s United States Center. To date, he noted, discussions on whether and how to curb the production of fossil fuels have been almost entirely absent from international climate talks.	1
But on the hills where his vines are planted, the soil was sandy with stones and no clay — good for growing grapes. “We are going to produce wine where it was not possible before,” Mr. Moesgaard said. No one can say they are happy about climate change. “But we should take advantage of the opportunities it brings.”	0
But some experts believe they could become a fixture of life in California for much longer. Michael Wara, director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University, says the extreme winds that are knocking down power lines and starting fires are only one factor. The conditions that we are observing right now are a function of climate change and climate change will get worse. California has contended for over a century with an annual wildfire season. But scientists have found that climate change — including longer, hotter and drier fire seasons, diminishing snowpack and lengthening droughts — have already measurably worsened the size and scale of fires in the western United States.	0
As summarized by the Guardian in 2004, here’s what the so-called “experts” assured us would happen by now: [emphasis added throughout] A secret report, suppressed by US defence chiefs and obtained by The Observer, warns that major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a ‘Siberian’ climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world. Abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The threat to global stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism, say the few experts privy to its contents. And that’s not the worst of it.	0
As the seas rise, they are also warming at a pace unanticipated as recently as five years ago. This is very bad news. The planet is more sensitive to increased carbon dioxide emissions than previously thought. The melting of permafrost has also defied expectations. This is ground that has remained frozen for at least two consecutive years and covers around a quarter of the exposed land mass of the Northern Hemisphere.	0
"It is time that NASA correct the record and present unbiased figures to the public."" According to the CEI complaint, NASA's decision to repeat the false claim violated the Information Quality Act (IQA). Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. The claim appears on the NASA website on the page ""Climate Change: How Do We Know?"" The claim traces back to a study led by John Cook entitled ""Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature"" and published in the journal Environmental Research Letters in 2013."	1
"Michael Knowles, the Daily Wire contributor whose blank book Reasons to Vote for Democrats became an Amazon bestseller two years ago, will no longer be a guest on Fox News after calling Greta Thunberg a ""mentally ill child"" during an appearance on The Story with Martha MacCallum Monday evening. Knowles had been discussing the absurdity of ""meatless"" diets and environmentalism. The climate hysteria movement is not about science. “If it were about science, it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.” This didn't go over well with the show's liberal guest. “I’m not, I’m attacking the left for exploiting a mentally ill child,” Knowles said."	2
"STRASBOURG, France — The EU budget chief said the bloc needs to invest dedicated funds to avert a ""climate crash"" as Brussels detailed how it planned to pay for a trillion euro push to cut net C02 emissions to zero by 2050 and protect member countries dependent on coal. The financial challenge for Europe is huge: the European Commission executive arm estimates that halving emissions by 2030 would require 260 billion euros (£222 billion) of investment a year in the energy, transport and construction sectors. We need climate cash in order to avoid a climate crash. Of the 1 trillion euros of the EU's 10-year investment plan, roughly half is to come from the EU long-term budget, the Commission said. This will trigger more than 100 billion in co-financing from governments."	1
The stretch approved Wednesday includes all federal land crossed by the line, Hammond said. Much of the rest of the route is across private land, for which TC Energy has been acquiring permissions to build on. Oil will make climate change worse, and that the pipeline could break and spill oil into waterways like Montana's Missouri River. They have filed numerous lawsuits. Hammond said Interior officials and other agencies have done a thorough review of the potential effects on the environment.	0
“It’s great news for ozone in the Southern Hemisphere,” Paul Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in a statement. “But it’s important to recognize that what we’re seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures. It is the third time in 40 years in which warming halted ozone depletion. “It’s a rare event that we’re still trying to understand,” Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with the Universities Space Research Association, said in a statement. “If the warming hadn’t happened, we’d likely be looking at a much more typical ozone hole.” But researchers added that these scientific events are not linked to climate change.	1
"The findings add pressure on Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is under a barrage of criticism for his government's handling of the crisis, as community support for climate action increases. Morrison on Monday boosted emergency funding for small businesses hit by the bushfires as the mounting costs of the disaster cast doubt on the government's ability to deliver a promised budget surplus. Strengthening Australia's carbon emission reduction targets will damage the economy. Public anger, however, remains high, stoked further when senior government officials publicly disputed climate change. ""It is a test of his leadership."	2
Four “perverse” attitudes that obstruct the quest for concrete solutions to the problem of climate change “range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation, or blind trust in technical solutions,” he said. These perverse attitudes, Francis said, “certainly do not help honest research and sincere and fruitful dialogue on building the future of our planet: denial, indifference, resignation and trust in inadequate solutions.” Last June, the pope threw his moral weight behind a carbon tax, saying is imperative to oblige people to curb the use of fossil fuels. A carbon pricing policy is essential if humanity wants to use the resources of creation wisely. “The failure to manage carbon emissions has produced a huge debt that will now have to be repaid with interest from those who come after us.” The cost of carbon usage must be paid here and now by those who use it, and not deferred for future generations to cover, he proposed. The pontiff warned of disastrous consequences if humanity does not immediately react to the threat of climate change, since the world has reached a “critical moment” and there is no time to waste.	0
“We will raise our red hands and taking responsibility for our actions,” the group’s website said. “We march in admission and recognition of the part we play in the injustice of this emergency, and the ongoing suffering of thousands of people around the world due to climate and ecological breakdown.” CLIMATE PROTEST IN EUROPE RESULT IN MORE THAN 250 ARRESTS, CRITICISM FROM GERMAN OFFICIAL According to the Guardian, five activists locked themselves together outside the door of the Kenyan High Commission to highlight the plight of the Sengwer people, who were displaced from their forest homes in the name of conservation. Any climate change solution should respect and take into consideration the rights of indigenous peoples around the world,. On Thursday, climate activists who climbed onto the roofs of trains were met with angry London commuters who took it upon themselves to drag them back to platforms. More than 1,750 people have been arrested and more are likely to come.	1
Natural gas, which is cleaner than coal but which still produces plenty of planet-warming emissions, is also poised to cut into coal’s market share. Still, the agency notes that coal is far from dead: Hundreds of coal plants that have already been built in Asia are only 12 years old on average and are capable of operating for decades to come. It will be extremely difficult for the world to rapidly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. This carbon capture technology remains costly and has struggled to gain traction. For years, it’s been much cheaper for most countries to build wind turbines on land.	1
"The world needs an open dialogue about climate change to heal the gap between sceptics and believers since time is running out to cut the emissions that drive global warming. ""Time is pressing, so we - the older ones, I am 65 years old - must make sure that we take the impatience of young people positively and constructively,"" Merkel told the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. The first two days of the annual Davos gathering were dominated by the back-and-forth between the 73-year-old former businessman Trump and 17-year-old campaigner Greta Thunberg, with corporate leaders caught in the middle, concerned that as well as words, there was a need for concrete decisions."	0
This is about politics, not climate Australia’s leftists have never forgiven Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s Liberal Party (ie Australia’s conservatives) for winning the general election in May 2019. That’s because it was billed as the ‘climate election’, which the left was supposed to win. Global warming is an election-winning issue. But the voters just aren’t interested. Everyone — encouraged by Australia’s left-leaning print media and rabidly left-wing state broadcaster ABC — was convinced that this was the election that was going to be won on climate change.	1

It requires huge land use and creates “heavy-metal pollution, noise, flicker effects, solar panel waste, wildlife destruction,” among other negative impacts of alternative energy sources. He also focused on the “anti-human core” and the “authoritarian implications” of the Green New Deal proposed by the Democrats. Global warming will be small, slow, harmless and net beneficial. There is no case, rational, scientific, political, economic, social, moral or other for any mitigation of global warming.

A new study warns that even if countries curb their carbon emissions pledge as part of the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement, sea levels will continue to rise. Sea levels would rise approximately 20 centimeters by the year 2300 from emissions released between 2016 and 2030, when the Paris Agreement expires. “Even if we were to meet these initial goals of the Paris agreement, the sea level commitment from global warming will be significant,” said one of the study&aposs co-authors, Oregon State University climate scientist Peter Clark, in a statement. “When we pump more carbon into the atmosphere, the increase in temperature is almost immediate.	1
A recent Bloomberg editorial beckons Americans to “curb their appetite” and “give up meat” claiming livestock are the boogeyman of greenhouse gas emissions. But if you look at the facts, they tell a completely different story. Beef cattle produce only 3.3 percent of the total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. By comparison, the transportation and electrical industries generate 56 percent of our nation’s total GHG emissions. In fact, researchers at Virginia Tech found that if every person in the country suddenly went vegan, GHG emissions would drop a mere 2.6 percent in the United States, while our national diet would suffer from insufficient nutrients.	2
"If the professional world of climate science is dominated by the ideology of climate alarmism, it would make sense that climate alarmists are more heavily cited than climate skeptics. In January 2017, Judith Curry, former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech, resigned, calling out the alarmist ideology that increasingly dominates her field. I no longer know what to say to students and postdocs regarding how to navigate the CRAZINESS in the field of climate science. ""Research and other professional activities are professionally rewarded only if they are channeled in certain directions approved by a politicized academic establishment — funding, ease of getting your papers published, getting hired in prestigious positions, appointments to prestigious committees and boards, professional recognition, etc."" ""How young scientists are to navigate all this is beyond me, and it often becomes a battle of scientific integrity versus career suicide (I have worked through these issues with a number of skeptical young scientists),"" Curry wondered."	1
It is not just that she is blissfully ignorant of many climate facts, but what she does supposedly know is just so wrong. If she were to return to the classroom, her lessons should serve to calm her fears. While the planet is in the midst of a warming trend of several hundred years, the Earth has not warmed at all since she was born. Her teachers could also assure her that our current temperatures are not at all unusual nor unprecedented, but very similar to previous warming trends over the last several thousand years. Moving on to Biology class, she could explore how plants rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) as the basic building block in the process of photosynthesis.	2
"After Trump said the United States had committed to joining the one trillion tree initiative, Thunberg retorted that fixing the climate crisis was not only about trees. Thunberg, who has taken a year off school to advocate action on climate change, hit back on Twitter, saying it did not take a degree to know the world was not meeting its climate targets. So either you tell us how to achieve this mitigation or explain to future generations and those already affected by the climate emergency why we should abandon our climate commitments. Before leaving Davos, Trump seemed to extend an olive branch, saying he wished he had seen Thunberg speak. 'MISUNDERSTOOD' Mnuchin said the Trump administration's stance on climate and Thunberg's criticism had been ""misunderstood."""	0
That makes global warming and its fallout relevant to the Fed, which is responsible for both financial regulation and for guiding the nation’s economy toward full employment and stable prices. But those threats force the central bank, which prizes its political independence, to walk a tightrope. Democrats tend to be much more concerned with climate than Republicans. Against that backdrop, United States monetary policymakers have been slow to create a concerted climate change research program, even as peers like the Bank of England began to talk frequently about the economics of global warming. This week brought a significant shift in that approach.	1
"Of the papers examined in the study, only 32.6 percent were interpreted as endorsing man-made global warming — and the authors of many of these papers objected to that characterization. So, in Nature Communications there is a study claiming that ""climate deniers"" get too much media attention. 78 percent of the ""climate deniers"" whom the study paints as unscientific actually have articles published in peer-reviewed journals. That study also based its assumptions off of the Cook study, which blatantly misrepresented data. Now, The Climate Mobilization is calling for the media to stop quoting ""climate deniers"" — most of whom have peer-reviewed articles in scientific journals — because they are somehow unscientific."	2
“There are a lot of people scrambling to really understand the nature of this catastrophic risk,” Mr. Frazier said. He called the wave of fires starting in 2017 “a complete wake-up moment for an industry that thought it knew what was on its books, but actually didn’t.” When insurers try to respond to risks they don’t understand, they tend to set premiums too high, to give themselves a buffer against error, according to Dr. Kousky of the Wharton Risk Center. When it comes to climate change, insurers may respond by setting premiums so high that insurance in many parts of the country becomes unaffordable. By seeking to protect people from higher prices, regulators could make the problem worse by pushing insurers out of dangerous areas altogether, experts say. That was already happening: For the ZIP codes most affected by wildfires in 2015 and 2017, the number of homeowners dropped by their insurance companies jumped 10 percent between 2017 and 2018, according to a report released in August by the California Department of Insurance.	1
The Guardian newspaper announced it is changing it style rules for staff that report on the environment in an article with the headline: “’It’s a crisis, not a change:’ the six Guardian language changes on climate matters.” The Guardian listed in the article the new words and phrases it will now employ in its reporting and also images (think polar bear on a tiny iceberg or fires in the Amazon) and explained its reasoning: “The urgency of climate crisis needed robust new language to describe it,” the Guardian reported. • Climate emergency” or “climate crisis” will be used instead of “climate change.” • “Climate science denier” or “climate denier” to be used instead of “climate sceptic.” • “Use “global heating” not “global warming.” • “Greenhouse gas emissions” is preferred to “carbon emissions” or “carbon dioxide emissions.” Although carbon emissions is not inaccurate, if we’re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere, this term recognizes all of the climate-damaging gases, including methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs etc.” And the Guardian believes emotion-evoking animals in its reporting will serve a purpose. Today we pledge to give the climate crisis the attention it demands. “People need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem – we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.” “Since we announced these changes, they have been reported widely, shared across social media channels, and even prompted some other media outlets to reconsider the terms they use in their own coverage,” the Guardian reported, adding that it is now incorporating CO2 levels to its weather coverage. “In order to keep below 1.5C of warming, the aspiration of the world’s nations, we need to halve emissions by 2030 and reach zero by mid century,” the Guardian reported.	0

"Australia’s reliance on coal-fired power makes it one of the world’s largest carbon emitters per capita and last year it approved a huge new coal mine by India's Adani Enterprises. U.S. climatologist and geophysicist Michael Mann told Reuters that Morrison's position was ""ridiculous"". If we continue to warm the planet, then we will in all likelihood exceed our adaptive capacity. ""In other words, there is no amount of adaptation that will allow Australians to contend with the impacts of climate change if we allow for a further escalation of the problem."" In fact, Mann said, Australia could become so hot and dry that its residents could join the ranks of the world's ""climate refugees."""	0
Global governmental action on climate change has lost momentum since the 2015 Paris climate agreement was reached. President Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the United States from the agreement, and the most recent climate talks to move the process forward, which were held in Madrid, were widely considered a disappointment. Governments are under a legal obligation, as well as a moral obligation, to significantly increase their ambition on climate change. Our human rights depend on it.” One of the plaintiffs in the case, Damian Rau, was 12 years old when the case was first filed. In a statement from Urgenda, he called the judgment “an example to the world that no one is powerless and everybody can make a difference.”	0
But at some point during this past winter (as the visitor center was closed to the public), workers replaced the diorama’s “gone by 2020” engraving with a new sign indicating the glaciers will disappear in “future generations.” Almost everywhere, the Park’s specific claims of impending glacier disappearance have been replaced with more nuanced messaging indicating that everyone agrees that the glaciers are melting. Some signs indicate that glacial melt is “accelerating.” A common trick used by the National Park Service at GNP is to display old black-and-white photos of glaciers from bygone years (say, “1922”) next to photos of the same glaciers taken in more recent years showing the glaciers much diminished (say, “2006”). Glaciers tend to grow for nine months each winter and melt for three months each summer. Thus, such photo displays without precise calendar dates may be highly deceptive. A spokeswoman for the Park, Gina Kurzman, has now confirmed the changes to CNN: The signs in the Montana park were added more than a decade ago to reflect climate change forecasts at the time by the US Geological Survey, park spokeswoman Gina Kurzmen told CNN.	1
That could inform decisions for people like farmers. For areas at risk of weather disasters like severe flooding, it could also be crucial for transportation officials and emergency planners. The heightened capabilities will be increasingly important in the age of climate change. “The weather is getting more volatile, the impacts are getting more severe, and the financial impacts are rising as a result.” The IBM initiative comes at a time of rising apprehension about the commercialization of weather forecasting and climate modeling. Some people already pay private companies for faster and more accurate information, and that raises some thorny questions.	1
To motivate listeners to action, climate composers also tend to include “best case” scenarios in their musical works. In “What If We…?” the music shifts halfway into the piece, from increasing gloom to a softer sound, representing what the world might be like if people implement changes in their behavior and government policies. Climate change is an urgent issue because we can still do something about it. After most performances, The ClimateMusic Project hosts question-and-answer sessions with the audience. They also work with local advocacy groups, such as the Cool Effect and the San Francisco Department of the Environment, to give people outlets where they can learn how to offset their own carbon emissions, or how to support legislation that may help mitigate climate change.	0
The climate crisis, in other words, would eventually become the moral equivalent of war — an emergency transcending the usual political divides. But if a nation in flames isn’t enough to produce a consensus for action — if it isn’t even enough to produce some moderation in the anti-environmentalist position — what will? Climate denial will persist come hell or high water. You might be tempted to dismiss Australia as a special case, but the same deepening partisan division has long been underway in the United States. As late as the 1990s, Democrats and Republicans were almost equally likely to say that the effects of global warming had already begun.	1
Even when alarmists restrain from making grandiose predictions of nuclear war, they often end up with egg on their faces. In 2018, the tiny Maldives Islands were scheduled to sink beneath the waves due to climate change — yet the islands have actually grown in recent years! Climate is an extremely complicated science that remains far less than fully understood. While it stands to reason that carbon emissions may have an impact on the global climate, there is little concrete evidence to prove it — and nearly every prediction made on this hypothesis has proven false.

Here’s what readers had to say about the last debate: Can California save itself from burning? Kiryn from the Bay Area commented: “I fear this is going to be normal for my daughter, who is too young to remember when the rains still started to fall in October and we didn’t call Autumn ‘Fire Season.’ But we can’t really leave — we’ve lived here all our lives, we’ve got good jobs, and all our family and friends are here. There are fewer climate problems elsewhere. Just different ones.” Jeff Dozier, professor emeritus and founding dean of the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in that while building codes exist, community codes more or less do not in fire-prone areas — and need to. He explained: “For example, some of the houses in a development push right against the edge, so the fire spreads into the development itself.	2
While kids were marching, singing, and twerking for the Global Climate Strike, a group of more than 500 scientists and professionals appealed to the United Nations for a long overdue, open debate on climate change. “Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the scientists stated in their declaration sent to the U.N. secretary general. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation. The signers also insisted that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable trend of the day. “There is no climate emergency.	2
If you first heard about the “Green New Deal” by word of mouth, you might be forgiven if your initial impression was one of disbelief. The cost alone is mind-boggling. The low-carbon electricity grid alone will cost $5.4 trillion. The “New Zero Emissions Transportation System” will cost about $2 trillion. Ocasio-Cortez’s program for a “guaranteed job for everyone”— somewhere between $6.8 trillion and $44.6 trillion.	1
Mr. Brouillette has described planetary warming as “something we need to work on” but has questioned the scientific consensus that climate change poses a serious threat. He has promoted statistics that show American emissions have fallen 13 percent since 2005, but he also is a critic of the Paris Agreement, a pledge among nearly every nation to curb emissions that Mr. Trump intends to abandon next November. Reductions of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are being nullified by rising emissions in China. In replacing Mr. Perry, Mr. Brouillette becomes the latest lobbyist and seasoned second-in-command to take over for an embattled, higher-profile cabinet secretary. Last year Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist who worked as the deputy administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under Scott Pruitt, took the helm when Mr. Pruitt resigned amid ethics scandals.	1
“Just like the recent case against Exxon-Mobil in New York that was dismissed, this case by ‘climate concerned children’ was prompted and powered by climate activist interests,” Anthony Watts, senior fellow at the Institute, said in a statement. “In both cases, huge amounts of money, time, and legal expertise were thrown at these claims in an attempt to make a legal case that climate change has been harmful.” “The bottom line is that while yes, we’ve seen some changes in our climate over the past century, with improved crop yields, better health, reduced deaths from weather disasters, and increasingly less impoverishment worldwide, it is hard to argue that an increase of about 1 degree Centigrade has been detrimental to humanity,” the statement continued. Ill-informed kids keep being manipulated by radical environmentalists to sue over purported future climate damages. “It’s time for federal and state courts to say enough is enough and toss all such lawsuits, recognizing as the Ninth Circuit did that it’s the job of elected branches, not the judiciary, to determine climate and energy policy.” “Undoubtedly, the plaintiffs arrived in court using transportation that relies on the very fossil fuels they would stop the world from using, and pleaded in a court house whose lights and indoor climate controls depend on those very same fossil fuels,” Burnett said. “Kids should stay in school, not in courthouses.” NBC reported the plaintiffs will file a petition for review in front of the entire 9th Circuit within 60 days.	2
Such a move could cost Italy more than 8,000 jobs. One environmental activist expressed reservations that Mr. Fioramonti’s plan may be too dogmatic. Climate change is not primarily caused by man. “To listen to people who say different things is good,” he said. “What the U.N. says is not gospel.” But as President Trump began pulling the United States out of the landmark Paris Agreement this week, Mr. Fioramonti said that every country needed to do its part to stop the “Trumps of the world” and that his ambition was to show children there was another way.	2
Is it possible to shift that way of thinking? In some ways, the costs of reducing climate change are overstated. Risky technologies are the only ways to address climate change. If you think about more public transit, more sustainable diets, more high-tech communities with perhaps more modest homes, these are things that can benefit people in the future, and likewise, I think in developing countries it will also require a shift away from present trends. What are some of the more positive developments that you’ve seen in the climate movement recently?	0
"The liberal writer lamented that ""one of the show's heroes single-handedly ended the existential climate threat with a clever knife trick — abruptly returning the storyline to a conventional tale of humans fighting among themselves for political power."" ""In the real world, climate change is far too challenging a threat to be ended by one person — or even one battle that doesn’t include all of the major powers,"" Romm piously preached.

Oreskes: This is a tough question. The Zen scholar Thich Nhat Hanh has said that technology makes major contributions to the minor needs of man. Climate change means the end of shopping.

Guests will be served a 100% plant-based meal just ahead of showtime Sunday. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Thursday that it wants the initiative to raise environmental awareness about food consumption and waste. The Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change. “The food we eat, the way we grow the food we eat, the way we dispose of the food is one of the large contributors to the climate crisis.” The annual awards ceremony will air on NBC from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. Soria said there was some initial push back about changing the menu just about two weeks before the show, but the hotel eventually agreed on the new menu.	1
Climate summits are stuck in a rut. The job of cutting global emissions is actually getting harder, and not just because the planet keeps warming. Climate summits have become festivals at which leaders talk about leadership.	1

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) joined climate change strikers outside of the Iowa Capitol Building in Des Moines as part of Friday’s global climate strike. Climate change is not a hoax, but climate change is a terrible, terrible reality impacting our country and the entire world today. “Not tomorrow, but today.” He told the group of activists: “And we know that if we’re going to save this planet … we have got to take on the fossil fuel industry, and we have got to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel,” he said, calling for “sustainable energy.” He said the “very bad” and “scary” news is that we face a “global existential crisis.” The good news, Sanders said, is “we can address this crisis if we have the courage to stand up to greedy and powerful special interests.” “I’m proud to stand with young people in Iowa and around the world today in their climate strikes,” Sanders wrote alongside a video of his appearance at the event. “This is about the future of the planet and we won’t accept a middle ground approach,” he added.	0

It doesn’t really matter which reason means the most to you as long as you actually go and stay vegan. Scientists say that if we all went vegan, it could save the lives of up to 8 million humans (not to mention billions of animals), cut greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds and prevent 1.5 trillion dollars’ worth of climate-related damage by 2050. More than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions come from meat, eggs and dairy. “It’s estimated that each vegan spares nearly 200 animals every year and that’s just counting the animals who are killed and eaten, like chickens, cows, pigs and fish.” The U.N. also blames animal agriculture, which helps feed people around the world, for habitat loss and the recent fires in the Amazon rainforest. And not only is a meat-based diet killing animals, it is killing people by causing heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, PETA claims.	1
Piers Corbyn, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexiteer climate-sceptic elder brother, has lambasted Extinction Rebellion as a Soros-funded, EU- and UN-backed scam to transfer money from ordinary people to corporations. Climate policy is there to control you, not climate. “The political origin of [Extinction Rebllion] is the globalist supernationals, the mega-rich. They’re funded by George Soros, among others, he spent 24 million dollars on the group which set up the so-called climate strike,” Corbyn alleged.	2
He invoked his own family twice in resonant ways, saying he had relatives in Hong Kong where there have been mass protests and unrest, and that he has a child with special needs. “Special needs is the new normal in this country,” he said, adding, “We have to stop confusing economic value and human value.” Of course, it helped that no one onstage seemed to see any advantage in challenging him. The government should pay to help Americans move out of places impacted by climate change. The moderator’s closing question was quirky: Would you prefer to ask for forgiveness or give someone a gift? Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar — the only two women onstage — were the only ones to say they would ask for forgiveness.	0

The money announced Thursday is to be spent on compensating workers, companies and the four coal producing states — three in the country’s east and one in the west. It followed months of negotiations between regional officials and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. Germany, one of the strongest and most successful industry nations in the world, is taking huge steps toward leaving the fossil fuel era. Germany’s timetable, though, could present challenges to the European Union’s efforts to swiftly cut its greenhouse gas emissions, as the bloc’s new leadership has announced. Countries around the world are watching how quickly the 28-country union, which, taken together is currently the third-largest emitter of planet-warming gases, can reduce its carbon footprint.	1
"Like an icy tongue, Pine Island Glacier links the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to the Amundsen Sea. It is one of the fastest-retreating glaciers in Antarctica, and calving incidents have increased in recent years, NASA reported. Warming ocean currents are also melting the glacier from underneath, washing ice away faster than the glacier can replenish it.

“These forests are working for us each year, soaking up large amounts of carbon,” Dr. Evans said. “But we don’t account for that when the damage happens.” International programs like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, or REDD+, are seen as a way to help limit global warming by using financial incentives to halt ongoing deforestation, thus conserving forests’ carbon-storing capabilities. Protecting still-undamaged forests could have a strong climate benefit as well. “From a number of different angles there’s a rising realization that we need to do more than just the core REDD approach,” Dr. Evans said. For one thing, if preserving an intact forest has a climate impact six times greater than previously thought, perhaps the financial incentive to preserve it should be substantially higher, he said.	0
“I guarantee, if we had a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month, I would not be the only candidate of color on stage tonight.” Okay, sure.

Two young climate change activists also made the list – American Jamie Margolin and Swede Greta Thunberg. “The future must be de-colonised and re-connected to the ancient wisdom of the Earth we once cherished.

Just as 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg addressed the U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, these signatories were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts. Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.” The signatories underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts. “There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent,” they declared.	1
Even fewer have set their own targets and timetables to do what the science demands: Reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by half over the next decade. While global investment in renewable energy hit $289 billion in 2018, far exceeding the investment in new fossil fuel power, wind and solar remain a small portion of total energy production. The real evidence of change would come when investors started exiting carbon-heavy companies, especially those with no transition plan. “What is going to cause the change?” she added. “If capital actually does start to fly, if it does actually make choices.” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ridiculed calls for fossil fuel divestment, singling out the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who called on the Davos crowd on Tuesday to immediately halt investments in oil, gas and coal.	1

"While it stands to reason that greenhouse gas emissions might impact the global climate, it is far from certain exactly what impact they have. The models to predict future temperature and other effects have all failed. That manmade climate change is a crisis is a false twisting of the actual data.

For Europeans and Chinese, climate change is the biggest challenge they face, topping access to healthcare and the threat of unemployment in the EU and access to healthcare and fear of a financial crisis in China. In the United States, climate change was seen as the second biggest challenge after access to healthcare, and more important than the third biggest threat -- political instability. Two thirds of people in Europe, the United States and China think their individual behaviour can help tackle climate change and more than three quarters of parents believe their children will bear the consequences of climate change. The survey also showed 93% of the Chinese were choosing public transport over cars for environmental purposes. In Europe the trend was 64% and in the United States 49%.	1
!” he asked, perplexed. And with that question, he opened the door to an incredibly constructive conversation about science, faith and truth. Climate change is not a belief system. We know that the earth’s climate is changing thanks to observations, facts and data about God’s creation that we can see with our eyes and test with the sound minds that God has given us. And still more fundamentally, I went on to explain why it matters: because real people are being affected today; and we believe that God’s love has been poured in our hearts to share with our brothers and sisters here and around the world who are suffering.	1
Bernie's old enough to have been around in the 1970s when Time and Newsweek were trumpeting that we were headed for another Ice Age, but again, never mind. Science is not the point. We are headed for climate Armageddon from warming in twelve years. These days, to run for president as a Democrat, you have to pledge the most absolute allegiance to the church of climate. If you don't—if you dare say something as obvious as did the renowned Danish writer and climate moderate Bjorn Lomborg—you might as well forget about any ambition and return to selling insurance (or bartending).	0
Michael Oppenheimer, a professor of geoscience and international affairs at Princeton University, said Mr. Sanders’s plan did not appear to take political realities into account. He also said he was disappointed that Mr. Sanders no longer supported a carbon tax, a position he embraced in 2016. A fee on the burning of fossil fuels is the most efficient way to drive down global warming. Still, Mr. Oppenheimer said, Mr. Sanders wins points on vision. “When I talk about these issues I have to be realistic, but that’s why I don’t run for president,” he said.	0
"CEI congratulates President Trump for keeping his most important deregulatory campaign promise and looking out for the country’s best interests."" CEI Senior Fellow Pat Michaels described the Paris Agreement as ""climatically meaningless"" and warned that the deal ""guarantees that China will produce the lion's share of carbon dioxide emissions for the foreseeable future."" Since 2005, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have dropped more than those from any other large industrialized nation. We didn’t have Paris in 2005 and we don’t need it now."" H. Sterling Burnett, senior fellow in environment and energy policy at the Heartland Institute, also celebrated the withdrawal."	1
As we did our work, we were struck and disturbed by how little political and industrial effort has been mobilized to deeply decarbonize economies, despite three decades of international talks on climate change. To change that, we offered two broad recommendations. Countries need to go beyond simply putting a price on carbon or adopting bold emissions goals. What’s required is a more strategic approach to policymaking aimed at reconfiguring technologies, business models, infrastructure and markets in each country’s greenhouse-gas-emitting economic sectors to reduce emissions. In an earlier era, that was called industrial policy, an approach that has fallen out of favor in many countries but, done smartly, is what’s needed now.	1
Your holiday traditions are contributing to climate change and hurting the planet.

Drawing from emails between state officials and the oil giant BP, the Inside Climate News reporter Marianne Lavelle reconstructed how the company used its clout to persuade Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington to water down his proposal to price carbon — then helped sink that proposal, despite BP’s publicly backing the idea in theory. They would look self-serving and out of touch if they tried to deny climate change. “So they’ve just turned around and said, ‘We know climate change is happening, we want to take action on it. Oh, but not this action,’ any time action comes up.” On the anniversary of the Camp Fire that destroyed much of Paradise, Calif., the Chico Enterprise-Record reporter Camille von Kaenel looked at where displaced residents had gone.	0
"""Time is pressing, so we - the older ones, I am 65 years old - must make sure that we take the impatience of young people positively and constructively,"" Merkel told the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. The first two days of the annual Davos gathering were dominated by the back-and-forth between the 73-year-old former businessman Trump and 17-year-old campaigner Greta Thunberg, with corporate leaders caught in the middle, concerned that as well as words, there was a need for concrete decisions. Opposing sides in polarised debates such as that on climate change had to learn how to talk with each other again. (Reporting by Joseph Nasr, editing by Thomas Escritt)"	1
The former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams has claimed that man-made climate change is “the largest challenge ever to the human race” and that those who do not believe in it have fallen for conspiracy theories. The former archbishop has voiced his support for the Greta Thunberg-led climate school strikes and last year backed Extinction Rebellion in its calls for mass protest in reaction to the “unprecedented global emergency” of anthropomorphic climate change. Anthropomorphic climate change is a scam. “We’ve got arguably the largest challenge ever to the human race in the shape of an environmental crisis,” he said during an interview with artist Grayson Perry. The former archbishop of the worldwide Anglican Communion said he believed that one of the driving forces of ‘climate denial’ was that it was “just too uncomfortable to face” because it will require people to “stop doing things [they] like doing” — implying that people ‘like’ rather than ‘need’ to do activities that require fossil-fuel energy like driving to work, heating houses to keep warm, and having lights on to see when it gets dark.	2
“We have no idea what that looks like from a public health perspective. But we know it is catastrophic.” The report, and its focus on children, comes at a time when youth climate demonstrations including school strike protests spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, the Sunrise movement and Extinction Rebellion have attracted attention. This may be the first time in the history of the United States that there are children wondering whether they are going to have a future, whether they should have children as a result of the potential for climate change to get worse and worse. This year, Jamie Margolin, the 17-year-old founder of the climate activist group Zero Hour testified before Congress. “Everyone who will walk up to me after this testimony saying I have such a bright future ahead of me, will be lying to my face,” she said.	0

Meanwhile, a recent article in Forbes magazine reported that publishing papers on climate change in academic literature based on flawed methods is a formula that has been “repeated time and time again.” “Like the introduction of a virus, the misleading reinterpretation of climate scenarios has subsequently expanded throughout the climate science literature and into leading assessments,” it states. “We have a well-funded effort to fundamentally change how climate science is characterized in the academic literature,” states author Roger Pielke, “how that science is reported in the media, and ultimately how political discussions and policy options are shaped.” Climate change activists are so anxious to get their point across that they are willing to cut academic corners, fudge data, and misuse models to create scenarios that respond to their needs, even if not to the truth. The corruption of climate science has occurred because some of our most important institutions have let us down. “The scientific peer review process has failed to catch obvious methodological errors in research papers. Leading scientific assessments have ignored conflicts of interest and adopted flawed methods.	2
The prime minister published a New Year’s message in newspapers across Australia that pushed back against international pressure for the country to do more. “Australians have never been fussed about trying to impress people overseas or respond to what others tell us we should think or what we should do,” Mr. Morrison said. His antipathy toward action on climate change has contributed to what they consider a hands-off response to the fires, treating them as a tragedy rather than a turning point. For months, Mr. Morrison rebuffed calls for a more forceful intervention by the federal government — like a broad military deployment or the largely symbolic declaration of a national emergency — by noting that firefighting had long been the responsibility of individual states. He changed course on Saturday, announcing a call-up of military reservists and new aircraft resources.	1
LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is meeting the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Thursday to discuss climate finance, Johnson's spokesman said.

The Santa Ana winds have been a phenomenon for thousands of years. Those regular wind events can lead to crisis when they intersect with the drier landscape and man-made triggers like the state’s failing private power infrastructure. California is about 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer today than it would be without climate change. “And so everything is occurring against that warmer backdrop.” The devastating Tubbs fire in 2017 was on the minds of emergency response teams as the Kincade fire began to spread the night of Oct. 23, said Mark Essick, who was sworn in as Sonoma County’s sheriff in January. When the Tubbs fire began, county officials decided not to send an alert because they wanted to avoid causing panic and traffic jams.	1
“All of the things I thought about her as a child proved true, and that was pretty special.” Ms. Robinson agreed: “I’m very happy to find myself in this wicked company at this stage in my life.” Ms. Kodikara has been thinking about climate justice for her entire life, she just did not know it. An artist by training and a producer by profession, Ms. Kodikara, who was born in England to Sri Lankan parents, had been involved with organizations championing immigration reform and helping asylum seekers, but, she said, “I hadn’t really thought about the connections between migration, immigration and climate because the common narratives hadn’t made climate appear relevant to black and brown people at all.” That changed after a conversation with her friend, Thanu Yakupitiyage, associate director of United States communications for 350.org, who had previously worked in immigration reform. I realized with all that has separated us from each other, climate justice is the great unifier. She and the co-hosts “understand the value of supporting these women and listening to the knowledge that they’ve hoarded for generations,” Ms. Kodikara said. “I don’t see anyone else doing that.” To her, it’s inherently logical: “What kind of solution are you really going to end up with if you don’t listen to all of the intelligent and experienced and informed voices?” she said.	1
The United States is responsible for one- quarter of all fossil fuel-generated carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today, twice China’s cumulative contribution, and far more than any other country. Is that fair? Global oil consumption will grow by seven million barrels a day through 2024. Nearly half of the growth is expected to go to meet the demands of consumers in China and India. That doesn’t sound fair, but an average American or Australian burns 10 to 15 times more oil than someone in India does, and five times more than someone in China.	1
"More intense weather events, bigger populations in the path of disasters and greater supply chain disruption in a globalised economy contributed to the sharp rise in economic damage, Aon said. ""Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the last decade of natural disasters was the emergence of previously considered 'secondary' perils – such as wildfire, flood, and drought – becoming much more costly,"" said Steve Bowen, director and meteorologist at Aon’s impact forecasting team. Climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanised areas. Last year was the second warmest year on record for land and ocean temperatures, though Aon said economic and insured losses were lower than in the previous two years. There were 409 natural catastrophe events totalling $232 billion in losses in 2019, with $71 billion covered by insurance programmes, the report said."	0

If she were to return to the classroom, her lessons should serve to calm her fears. For example, in Science class she would learn that worldwide surface measurements reveal that, while the planet is in the midst of a warming trend of several hundred years, the Earth has not warmed at all since she was born. Our current temperatures are not at all unusual nor unprecedented, but very similar to previous warming trends over the last several thousand years. Moving on to Biology class, she could explore how plants rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) as the basic building block in the process of photosynthesis. She would find that, rather than being a pollutant, CO2 is fueling plant growth and that an increase in this gas is leading to higher crop productivity and a “greening” of the Earth.	2
Ultimately, more atmospheric carbon dioxide has the same beneficial impact on farm production as it does in greenhouse growing facilities. Also, warmer temperatures bring longer growing seasons and fewer devastating frost events. Climate change is causing global or regional crop devastation. The proof is in the objective crop production data. James Taylor (JTaylor@heartland.org) is director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute.	0
But I also think that a narrative of sacrifice doesn’t go over well with many people whom we’ll need as collaborators in addressing climate change. In any case, it isn’t necessary. There is a realistic win-win outcome: with the right government policies, we can stimulate investment in green energy, efficient cities, better transportation and the like, which will address climate change as well as make many of our lives better and more comfortable. Just think about it: Many Americans spend hours every day in traffic. Wouldn’t that be a great thing to change?	0
This is a climate action summit,” Guterres said. “The best science, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, tells us that any temperature rise above 1.5 degrees will lead to major and irreversible damage to the ecosystems that support us. Science tells us that on our current path, we face at least 3-degrees Celsius of global heating by the end of the century. “The climate emergency is a race we are losing, but it is a race we can win,” he declared. Guterres praised government and business entities for attending the Climate Action Summit to announce major climate-change initiatives.	1
"""Scholars of Australian populism agree, arguing that the weakening of the major parties and the country’s tilt to the right have been driven mainly by class envy and alienation, including the belief that the elite do not understand the needs and values of the working class,"" Cave wrote. Morrison won by representing himself as an everyman. Australians care about the high cost of environmental activism based on questionable climate alarmism. Just as the high cost of the Green New Deal drives people away from that radical legislation, so Australia's Labor Party lost by championing climate alarm at costs that voters are not willing to stomach. Yet The New York Times seems bent on climate alarmism, and liberals seem unwilling to learn the lesson that voters aren't willing to suffer in the name of fighting questionable climate threats."	2
As other Christian leaders, such as Pope Francis, have done, the WCC laments the failure of the recent COP25 climate conference to reach new international commitments to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the text states, we see that “nations are failing to keep pace with their commitments, that the dangers and damage of climate change are even worse than we feared, and that the time remaining for us to halt climate damage is less than we hoped.” In the U.N. climate talks, “we learned that 200 nations have failed to respond sufficiently to the growing urgency of the climate crisis,” it notes. The gap is widening between the steps taken by governments in response to the climate emergency, on the one hand, and the compelling scientific evidence and moral obligation to act, on the other. The Vatican praises Rev. Tveit for calling all the faithful to “creative action” and “advocacy” in combating climate change.	0
“Moreover, producing energy-intensive batteries for these cars invariably generates significant CO2 emissions,” he says, so that electric cars have a huge carbon deficit when they hit the road, and “will start saving emissions only after being driven 60,000 kilometers.” Even if sustained political pressure and increased subsidies were able raise the percentage of electric cars in the world to 15 times their present numbers by 2040, electric cars would only reduce global CO2 emissions by just 1 percent, he notes, citing a report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). “We already spend $129 billion per year subsidizing solar and wind energy, yet these sources meet just 1.1% of our global energy needs,” he adds, and yet the IEA estimates that “by 2040 — after we have spent a whopping $3.5 trillion on additional subsidies — solar and wind will still meet less than 5% of our needs.” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol put the figures in stark perspective, noting that in 2018, electric cars saved 40 million tons of CO2 worldwide, equivalent to reducing global temperatures by a mere 0.000018°C — or a little more than a hundred-thousandth of a degree Celsius — by the end of the century. You can save the climate with electric cars. The fact is, Lombord declares “cheap and reliable energy underpins human prosperity” and this will be provided by fossil fuels until alternative sources of cheap and reliable energy can be found. Only by producing green energy that is “cheap enough to outcompete fossil fuels” will any significant reduction of emissions take place, Lombord concludes.	0

The Paris Agreement provides the context for national and global policies in areas like agriculture and energy, which have direct implications for businesses with customers and suppliers around the world. A decade ago, many people viewed climate action and economic growth as being in conflict. Long-term growth and climate action are inextricably linked. For example, a report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate found that bold action on protecting the climate could generate over $26 trillion in benefits through 2030. As climate impacts intensify, they are projected to become more costly.	1
But Europe has been threatening such a tax for years and, so far, has not followed through. Mr. Pompeo, in his remarks on Twitter, said that the United States would still maintain a voice in international discussions on global warming. We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters. “Just as we have in the past, the United States will continue to research, innovate, and grow our economy while reducing emissions and extending a helping hand to our friends and partners around the globe,” he said. While no other nation has followed Mr. Trump’s lead and left the Paris Agreement — indeed, more countries have joined — few are toughening their emissions-reduction targets.	0

Meanwhile, on September 23, 500 leading climate scientists and professionals sent a European Climate Declaration to the secretary-general of the United Nations and the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. These 500 climate scientists and professionals wrote that there is no climate emergency and that false foundations for climate panic could lead to policy disasters causing massive harm, by destroying energy sources needed for survival. There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent. “However, CO2-mitigation measures are as damaging as they are costly. For instance, wind turbines kill birds and bats, and palm-oil plantations destroy the biodiversity of the rainforests.” “There is no climate emergency.	2
“He needs to get his act together,” the New York Democrat and co-author of the Green New Deal said when approached by a reporter from TMZ. “He needs to stand up to the fossil fuel corporations and the fossil fuel industry.

In addition, the president has long voiced support for the nation’s coal industry, and last June the Environmental Protection Agency finalized a plan to roll back emissions rules for the industry that were implemented by the Obama administration. Earlier in the brief conversation, Ocasio-Cortez spoke about the “horrifying” fires raging across Australia and used that as a jumping-off point for broader comments about climate change in general – even though nearly 200 arson-related arrests in Australia since the start of wildfire season have raised doubts about how many blazes were the result of climate change.	2

ROME — The deputy director of the Vatican’s communications office declared this week that the U.N.’s COP25 climate change convention had “ended in failure” as world leaders reached no agreement regarding a global carbon market. Speaking in Madrid at the book launch of A Great Hope: The Custody of Creation, a collection of writings by Pope Francis on the environment, Alessandro Gisotti said Monday that while “it is true that the summit has ended in failure” there is, at least, greater consciousness of the problem of climate change. Civil society has a renewed awareness of environmental issues and climate change like never before, despite the failure of COP2. “Society’s awareness is very important,” Mr. Gisotti said, adding that it is young people who are leading the way in care for the environment. “In fact, young people around the world, believers and non-believers alike, feel that Pope Francis is perhaps the only adult world leader who takes responsibility for actions that affect the new generations,” he remarked.	1
(As an aside, one cannot help wondering how something that has occurred “repeatedly” in the past can be called irreversible, but such is the nature of climate change rhetoric.) “In our view, the clearest emergency would be if we were approaching a global cascade of tipping points that led to a new, less habitable, ‘hothouse’ climate state,” the authors warn, while arguing that that cascading effects “might” be common. Some scientists counter that the possibility of global tipping remains highly speculative. “It is our position that, given its huge impact and irreversible nature, any serious risk assessment must consider the evidence, however limited our understanding might still be. To err on the side of danger is not a responsible option.” In other words, since apocalyptic scenarios of global chaos and destruction are not unthinkable but “might” happen if things go really badly, people should radically alter their lifestyles in a way that possibly could keep such calamities from occurring.	1
The plaintiff in the case, Ioane Teitiota, had argued that he and his family were threatened by the lack of fresh water and violent land disputes as the ocean encroaches on Kiribati. The panel concluded that he had failed to provide sufficient evidence for his claims and that while Kiribati is likely to become uninhabitable, there is still a chance the island's government might avert this.

We study the ocean.” Brian Roberts, associate director of science at the consortium, said, “there are so many opportunities you lose if you just pack up and leave.” Longtime measurements from the site would be disrupted by a move, he noted. The facility has already raised the height of docks for its two research ships and renovated the facility to move equipment to higher floors. Global sea-level rise is one of the greatest challenges facing society in the 21st century, and understanding how this phenomenon impacts coastal systems, infrastructure and the people who use them requires a regular coastal presence. The consortium is also building an additional facility on higher ground, about 30 miles to the north in the city of Houma, La., which could handle operations on days when the DeFelice center can’t be used. Ms. McClure, the architect, said that the encroaching seas had helped set her on her current area of study: “how buildings get decommissioned as the oceans begin to take them.” For a field that could be called unbuilding, she noted, “If you decide you’re going to let the ocean take it, taking it down will cost a lot of money.” Worse, she said, looking even farther ahead, “What happens when it’s entire communities?”	0

Democrat presidential candidates on Monday lauded Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg’s scathing speech targeting world leaders for what she described as their inaction against ecological self-extermination. A teenager had to speak out against purported global warming. “What a disgrace that it takes a 16-year-old to tell world leaders what they won’t acknowledge: We cannot continue with this type of ruthless capitalism that is destroying our planet. This is why we need young people leading our climate justice movement,” he said, sharing a video snippet of the 16-year-old’s remarks.	1
You want to go into each industry and look at the firms that are the most and least exposed to climate change.” To investors and advisers working with people’s savings, that approach is as nuanced as it is complex. Some investors with a green focus have been too doctrinaire, which could make this approach challenging, said Rusty Vanneman, chief investment officer of Orion Advisor Solutions, which manages about $17 billion. You could have two people in the same room who agree about the details of climate change investing, but then they start fighting over the nuance. “Or let’s say the average company has a green score of 50.

The generation that has grown up with the constant drumbeat of manmade climate change is now shaping public policy, including some young conservatives who have launched a nationwide campaign in support of a carbon tax. The issue is more about globalization than saving the planet. The article pointed out that Trump has rejected the climate doomsday scenario and has instead acted to help the U.S. energy sector by slashing regulations and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, both policies aimed at helping American workers and the economy. The college Republicans behind the carbon tax campaign said the Party should have, ahead of the 2020 election, a climate change plan in place.	2

""That's not a failure of science; it's just the reality of how tough the problem is.""

The ministry said China’s CO2 emissions per unit of GDP had fallen last year by 4% from a year earlier to stand at 45.8% less than in 2005. Vice Minister Zhao Yingmin told reporters that completed the target of CO2 reduction for 2020 ahead of schedule, while 14.3% of the energy China consumes now comes from non-fossil fuel sources. These are hard-won results from the efforts of promoting a green and low carbon economy.

"Therein, Chris Cillizza labeled the president “one of the most prominent climate change deniers in the world.” Climate activists recognize that any point of view can be effectively discredited by making an analogy, even indirectly, with Holocaust denial. We can take advantage of this by pointing out that it is both irrational and offensive to Holocaust survivors and their families to equate the possibility of future climate problems with one of the most horrific events in history. Climate changes all the time, although he sensibly questions the degree to which it is caused by human activity.

As climate impacts intensify, they are projected to become more costly. According to the recent National Climate Assessment, by the end of the century, warming at the current trajectory would cost the American economy hundreds of billions of dollars from crop damage, lost labor and the consequences of extreme weather. Climate change could cost the United States 10.5 percent in real income by 2100. In addition, by backing away from the international climate pact, the United States will fail to fully seize the economic opportunities in the growing clean energy sector. At the same time, other countries — including the nation’s biggest economic competitors — are seizing the opportunities in wind, solar and low-carbon innovation and technology.	0
A decade ago, many people viewed climate action and economic growth as being in conflict. Now it’s clear that long-term growth and climate action are inextricably linked. Bold action on protecting the climate could generate over $26 trillion in benefits through 2030. As climate impacts intensify, they are projected to become more costly.

Earth’s climate is changing around us. From the frequent wildfires in California to the increasingly severe cyclones in the Indian Ocean, evidence of human-caused global warming is becoming clear. But even as polls indicate a growing acceptance of the reality of global warming, many people are still not motivated enough to act. Lately, to convey the urgency of climate change at a personal level, scientists have begun translating its dry data points into heart-rending melodies. “Music is really visceral,” said Stephan Crawford, founder of The ClimateMusic Project, a San Francisco-based group that creates music based on climate data.	1

The climate agreement, which went into force Nov. 4, 2016, committed countries that signed the measure to take certain voluntary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The accord banned countries from announcing their intent to withdraw in its first three years, meaning Monday was the first day the U.S. was allowed to submit its intent to leave the agreement since it went into force in 2016. The Paris climate agreement harms the U.S. economy and would hurt American jobs if left to stand.

In a Twitter message, Mr. Sánchez said “multilateral climate action is a priority” for both the United Nations and the European Union. Chile’s sudden withdrawal had prompted United Nations officials to scramble to find a venue and a host country ready to accommodate an estimated 20,000 delegates. It is encouraging to see countries working together in the spirit of multilateralism to address climate change. The annual United Nations-sponsored talks are designed to help stave off the most catastrophic effects of climate change. They are part of the 2015 Paris climate accord, under which countries agreed to set their own targets to rein in their own greenhouse gas emissions.	0

Stable retirement savings, national health care, affordable college education — Australia solved all these issues decades ago. But climate change is Australia’s labyrinth without an exit, where its pragmatism disappears. The politics of climate in Australia resist even the severe pressure that comes from natural disaster. Instead of common-sense debate, there are culture war insults. The deputy prime minister calls people who care about climate change “raving inner-city lunatics.” Another top official suggests that supporting the Greens party can be fatal.	1
Some of the signers hail from the nation’s leading institutions, including Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, and Bristol universities, as well as the London School of Economics and Imperial College London. The academics note that they are particularly well suited to the task of saving the world from global warming, given their expertise and prestige among the common people. Universities are the bastions of wisdom and knowledge that are urgently needed to combat the climate crisis. “Now is the time to increase our efforts.” Occasionally straying into hyperbole and remarkably unscientific language, the letter asserts that “the crisis is at our doorstep” and that humanity now faces “an even greater challenge” than going to the moon in the 1960s. “We ask you to support scientists, academics and students to help address the climate emergency through a series of new programmes, fellowships, sabbaticals and voluntary placements to help the critical efforts needed to save all life on our planet,” the letter pleads.	0

Rebecca Newsom, the head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the Tory manifesto was “full of holes” on the environment and had been judged inadequate by green groups, and people would expect swift action. “The weight of responsibility and growing public concern now rests on Boris Johnson’s shoulders to ensure the UK rises to the challenge, fights for climate justice and shows real leadership,” she said. The next five years are make or break for the climate and nature emergencies. This should start with a climate emergency budget to pledge at least 5% government spending per year to deliver a fairer and greener economy for all.” Climate breakdown was one of the top concerns of younger voters during the election campaign, and Labour made it the centrepiece of its “green industrial revolution” pledge to voters.

What the Chesters have learned is how to integrate all the different kinds of food production with one another, and with the specific environmental conditions of the farm’s location, in a way that is very nearly self-sustaining: “And all of that is crucial knowledge that we need to apply to bigger food-systems production,” Ms. Little says. The use of crop diversity and companion planting to enrich the soil and manage pests, for example, is essential to reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and chemical insecticides, though most industrial farms still rely on a mono-cropping approach to food production. In California, however, which is already being ravaged by the heat and drought of climate change.

OUR UNIVERSE MAY BE A GIANT LOOP, NEW STUDY CLAIMS The model used in the new study did take those factors into account. “There was a significant shift toward treating forests as a renewable, rather than nonrenewable, resource in the last century, and we estimate that those reforestation and forest management efforts have led to a far smaller carbon burden on the environment,” Sohngen said. Efforts to decrease carbon emissions should focus on industry. Sohngen also pointed out that environmental protection work should not ignore forests, suggesting that governments globally could provide more incentives to promote better forest management.

The intense downpours are characteristic of climate change, said Barbara Mayes Boustead, an author of the National Climate Assessment’s chapters on the Midwest and Northern Great Plains. While linking individual weather events is a complex and time-consuming process involving attribution science, the trends are clear, she said. Climate change has changed the atmosphere itself. So even if it is difficult to prove the precise impact of climate change on this year’s season, she added, “events like this become more likely as climate changes.” And the rain is not just intense, but comes at inopportune times, said Dennis Todey, the director of the Agriculture Department’s climate hub in Ames, Iowa. Rains are falling hard not in the middle of the growing season, when it could be of the most use, but in the spring and fall, “exactly the time we don’t want more water on our cropland.” “Almost all farmers agree that they’ve been dealing with much more volatile conditions,” said Mr. Lehman, the Iowa farmer.	0

My sense is that reporters and editors have finally gotten over that block.

WASHINGTON — If you asked us why a dozen people sat on the floor next to the A.T.M. in a Chase Bank branch on Friday, waiting for the police to arrest us for this small act of civil disobedience, we would come up with the same answer as the famous robber Willie Sutton: “Because that’s where the money is.” We don’t want to empty the vaults. The money inside the vaults of banks like Chase is driving the climate crisis. Cutting off that flow of cash may be the single quickest step we can take to rein in the fossil fuel industry and slow the rapid warming of the earth. JPMorgan Chase isn’t the only offender, but it is among the worst.	0
“We need to break the cognitive dissonance in as many ways as we can in order to be more real with what’s happening,” Mr. Leonard said.

Altering habits like how we eat can make people feel more empowered and less overwhelmed, he said, and can shift our relationship with the natural world. After all, the belief that natural resources exist for our heedless exploitation got us to this point in the first place (and made us none the happier).	0
Add to this the deliberate deception of climate change deniers who promote the (misleading) narrative that fixing the problem is too expensive and it will be cheaper and easier to adapt, and you’ve pretty much got a recipe for inaction — or at least insufficient action. People need to know how dreadfully expensive climate inaction has already become and how much more expensive it will become if we don’t get our act together. In 12 years (11 now), we fall off the cliff of climate catastrophe and face the end of humanity.

“This will require me to stop doing a lot of things I like doing.

ICCC13 Panel One concerned “Scientific Observations,” in particular, the science presented in Climate Change Reconsidered II: Fossil Fuels, the latest volume of peer-reviewed research by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC). The panel also focused on climate modeling vs. observed temperature data, and the Sun’s dominant influence on climate change. Future warming will be benign, supporting his position with convincing data. After tracing the history of the IPCC and the NIPCC, Dr. David Legates of the University of Delaware proposed that NIPCC reports be encapsulated in an online format that would be quick and easy for students and others to access. Dr. Roy W. Spencer of the University of Alabama in Huntsville described how poorly computer models correlate with real climate change and concluded that there is no climate crisis or climate emergency.	2

"Reporting for RealClear Energy, James Taylor, senior fellow, Environment and Energy Policy, for the Arlington, Illinois-based Heartland Institute, describes the results of the new (since January 2005) National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Reference Network (USCRN). USCRN includes 114 well-located and maintained temperature stations spaced relatively uniformly across the lower 48 states. USCRN temperature stations show no warming since 2005 when the network went online. If anything, U.S. temperatures are now slightly cooler than they were 14 years ago [see graph below, where temperature is in degrees Fahrenheit on the left]."" Taylor concludes: “Climate crisis advocates attempt to dismiss the minor satellite-measured warming by utilizing ground temperature stations around the globe, which tend to have even more corrupting biases and problems than the old U.S. stations.” There are, of course, huge regions of the Earth that have no land surface temperature data at all."	2
She would find that, rather than being a pollutant, CO2 is fueling plant growth and that an increase in this gas is leading to higher crop productivity and a “greening” of the Earth.

Seek out a spiritual path to forge gratitude, compassion and acceptance, because operating out of denial, anger or fear only hurts us in the end. There is dismissiveness about whether individual choices like how we consume and transport ourselves matter: Why cancel that trip to Europe if it’s too late anyway and if everyone is still addicted to fossil fuels? Living like climate change is real and that we can do something about it are signals to others.

What is very much at issue is the alleged ""anthropogenic"" nature of that change, as well as such unanswered questions as what the “ideal” average world temperature should be, and who gets to make that declaration.

In an angry speech at the UN, Thunberg told world leaders that they had “stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words…You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us.” But young people like Thunberg lack the maturity and experience to make sense of this immensely complex issue. The climate scare will soon lose credibility as global warming.

The study, by researchers from the Wildlife Conservation Society, the University of Queensland in Australia and other institutions, analyzed carbon emissions from the loss of intact tropical forests worldwide from 2000 to 2013. Immediate clearing of intact forests, what might be considered “classic” deforestation, over that period accounted for about 3 percent of global emissions from deforestation in all tropical forests, the researchers said. The carbon impact increased sixfold over the period. “It’s alarming, because there are huge amounts of intact forest being disturbed every year,” said Tom Evans, who leads the forest conservation program at the Wildlife Conservation Society and was a co-author of the paper, which was published in Science Advances. Worldwide in the first decade and a half of the 21st century, about 9 percent of intact forests were opened up to degradation and deforestation.	0

Climate change and its effects are accelerating, with climate related disasters piling up, season after season. “Things are getting worse,” said Petteri Taalas, Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization, which on Tuesday issued its annual state of the global climate report, concluding a decade of what it called exceptional global heat. But reducing greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change will require drastic measures. “The only solution is to get rid of fossil fuels in power production, industry and transportation,” he said. Seas are warming and rising faster, putting more cities at risk of tidal flooding or worse.	0
It makes it illegal “by any means or in any manner” to hunt, take, capture or kill birds, nests or eggs from listed species without a permit. Beginning in the 1970s, federal officials used the act to prosecute and fine companies up to $15,000 per bird for accidental deaths on power lines, in oil pits, in wind turbines and by other industrial hazards. Fossil fuel companies had been unfairly targeted by the law. “It felt like it was weaponized against one industry,” she said. Changes to the interpretation of the law topped the association’s wish list for the Trump administration.	1
People are more likely to listen to a message when it comes from someone they trust, Alexander Maki has argued in The Washington Post, and messages about climate change are no different. “For example,” he writes, “experimental research discovered that when free-market enthusiasts who are concerned about government regulation hear from experts who emphasize how companies are developing climate responses, they are more likely to accept climate science.” Who makes for the best messenger depends, naturally, on the intended recipient. Because climate change perceptions in children seem less susceptible to the influence of worldview or political context, it may be possible for them to inspire adults toward higher levels of climate concern, and in turn, collective action. Child-to-parent intergenerational learning — that is, the transfer of knowledge, attitudes or behaviors from children to parents — may be a promising pathway to overcoming socio-ideological barriers to climate concern. While leading with data and studies can cause people to shut down, Ms. Puniewska writes, talking about the scientific consensus around climate change in general can help, acting as a kind of gateway to greater trust in the conclusions of climate science.	0
Naomi Oreskes: One reason we’ve failed to act on climate change is the persistent perception that it’s far away in time and space. For decades, climate change was a prediction about the future, so scientists talked about it in the future tense. Climate disruption is underway. Scientists also often focus on regions of extreme vulnerability, such as Bangladesh or the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which for most Americans are very remote, both physically and psychically. Then there’s the issue that Nick Stern and I raise in the Op-Ed essay: the underestimation of the costs of climate impact.	0
Those efforts usually focus on stopping the destruction in areas where it is already occurring. But a new study suggests these programs would do well to also preserve forests where deforestation and degradation haven’t begun. Gradual loss of these largely pristine, intact forests has a much greater climate impact than previously accounted for. Globally, forests take more than a quarter of the carbon emissions from human activities out of the atmosphere every year. Intact forests are especially effective at storing carbon — although only about 20 percent of tropical forests are considered relatively pristine, they are responsible for about 40 percent of carbon storage in the tropics.	0

"They are not in the same league with top scientists.

The study did not mention how many of the ""climate change scientists"" quoted by the media had published articles, but the authors selected 224 of their papers and showed how their papers were more heavily cited. If the professional world of climate science is dominated by the ideology of climate alarmism, it would make sense that climate alarmists are more heavily cited than climate skeptics."	1
The researchers state that they are looking for “the best strategies for providing data to drive those actions that can leverage big course corrections in the way our society operates, triggering and sustaining transition to a low carbon, low environmental footprint economy within a safe operating space for humanity.” In other words, the team wishes to generate climate change propaganda that will convince decision-makers to alter the course of nations based on fears of climate disaster should certain “boundaries” be exceeded. “An effective PHW is vital to galvanise much needed action to address the growing threats to planetary health including urgent actions to address the climate crisis,” the authors conclude. Publishing papers on climate change in academic literature based on flawed methods is a formula. “We have a well-funded effort to fundamentally change how climate science is characterized in the academic literature,” states author Roger Pielke, “how that science is reported in the media, and ultimately how political discussions and policy options are shaped.” Climate change activists are so anxious to get their point across that they are willing to cut academic corners, fudge data, and misuse models to create scenarios that respond to their needs, even if not to the truth. “The corruption of climate science has occurred because some of our most important institutions have let us down,” Pielke writes.	2
And it has constructed air bases on an archipelago of artificial islands across the South China Sea. At home, Australian voters have also become increasingly concerned about the growing influence of Chinese money in the country’s political scene. Our economy is vitally dependent on fossil fuels, and yet our landscape is relatively exposed to climate change. Shifting the world’s 14th-largest economy would be no easy task, no matter how much the government might do. Australia not only burns coal to generate most of its own electricity but also exports nearly $40 billion a year of the fuel, mainly to Japan, China, India, South Korea and Taiwan.	1
"The study analyzed all published peer-reviewed academic research papers from 1991 to 2011 that use the terms ""global warming"" or ""global climate change."" The study placed the papers into seven categories: explicit endorsement with quantification, saying humans are responsible for 50+ percent of climate change; explicit endorsement without quantification; implicit endorsement; no position or uncertain; implicit rejection; explicit rejection with qualification; and explicit rejection without qualification. Natural causes explain climate change. So how did Cook and his team come up with the 97 percent number? They added up the first three categories (3,896 papers), compared them to the last three categories (78 papers) and the papers expressing uncertainty (40 papers), and completely ignored the nearly 8,000 papers that did not state a position."	2
"Compared to Bernie's $17-trillion and AOC's $30-trillion Green New Deal, Booker's proposal is an absolute bargain. But in addition to being a Warrior for Gaia, Booker wants to set up an ""Environmental Justice Fund"" to fix the problem of income inequality. What does economic inequality have to do with climate change? Well, nothing. Nothing at all."	1
As a conservationist and sustainable tourism expert, I am an advocate for a more responsible approach to tourism. Although I began my career as a wildlife ecologist, my work in the tourism industry is focused on transforming travel to be more environmentally friendly. Flying is harmful to the climate. Conservation and poverty alleviation will suffer twin blows. By 2030, tourism to Africa is projected to generate more than $260 billion annually.	0
If there’s anything the Trump years have shown it's that we can have cleaner air and water without sacrificing economic growth and jobs, but Democrats would put people out of work if they thought some initiative might prevent half a degree difference in global temperatures over 200 years. But, no candidate seems more obsessed with climate change than Bernie Sanders. Global climate change initiatives are just rebranded socialist policies. When given the opportunity to talk about the lack of diversity on the debate stage, Sanders chose to ignore the question and just start gabbing about climate change. “I wanted to get back to the issue of climate change for a moment because I do believe this is the existential issue,” he said.	2
Supporters say the candidates are reacting to voter frustration over sluggish wage growth and spiking costs across working families’ lives, including housing, child care, schools and health care, along with concerns about inaction toward climate change. “I think people don’t care as much about taxes as they care about how their life is going,” said Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist who helped develop a list of possible tax increases and spending cuts that Ms. Warren drew on to fund her health care proposal. Our climate problems have only gotten worse. “Corporate greed has only gotten worse. We’ve continued to see the gains go disproportionately to the top.	0
The fossil fuel divestment movement, which started small at schools like Swarthmore around 2011, is now a global movement with commitments from more than a thousand organizations and tens of thousands of individuals controlling some $8.8 trillion in combined assets. At the end of last year, Lawrence Bacow, the president of Harvard, told The Harvard Crimson that there were more effective ways to “bring about meaningful change” than divestment. While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it. “Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions.” Karen N. Peart, a Yale spokeswoman, said, referring to the protest, that the university stood “firmly for the right to free expression” but added that it was “regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities.” This is not the first public action taken against Ivy League endowments. In September, hundreds of students and other participants marched through Yale calling for divestment.	0
It very difficult to write plays about climate change. By the time one of her climate change plays reached the stage, the science had changed to the point that the play was outdated. According to a report by The Daily Pennsylvanian, Bard College Drama Professor Madeleine George argued recently that it is very difficult for artists to create art that reflects on issues presented by climate change.	1
That is, one of America’s two major parties is beyond redemption; given that, it’s hard to see how democracy can long endure, even if Trump is defeated. However, the scariest reporting I’ve seen recently has been about science, not politics. Climate change in the Arctic is accelerating, matching what used to be considered worst-case scenarios. And there are indications that Arctic warming may be turning into a self-reinforcing spiral, as the thawing tundra itself releases vast quantities of greenhouse gases. Catastrophic sea-level rise, heat waves that make major population centers uninhabitable, and more are now looking more likely than not, and sooner rather than later.	0
BATON ROUGE, La. The U.S. government violated their human rights by failing to take action on climate change. The complaint was filed Wednesday, The Advocate reported. Sea-level rise and coastal erosion are drowning tribal burial sites in South Louisiana, according to the complaint.	0
A quarter of humanity lives in countries that are using almost all the water they have, according to data published by the World Resources Institute in August. Shortages have plagued places from California to Cape Town, South Africa, which narrowly escaped running out of water last year. But Australia, the most arid inhabited continent, is unique among developed nations in its vulnerability to the effects of climate change. With the country’s driest spring on record just concluded and another hot, parched summer likely to be ahead, the challenge of keeping Australia hydrated is only becoming more urgent. “People think about climate change as this very faraway prospect, but in fact, it’s here now,” said Joelle Gergis, a senior lecturer in climate science at the Australian National University in Canberra and an author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.	0
The number of people threatened by climate change-triggered flooding is about three times higher than previously thought. But it&aposs not because of more water. It&aposs because the land, especially in Asia and the developing world, is several feet lower than what space-based radar has calculated, according to a study in the journal Nature Communications Tuesday.	0
Under his projections, Australia would not have seen this kind of devastation for another 40 to 50 years, he said. “I guess I’m as shocked as anyone about what’s unfolding and, probably, like everyone else who’s involved and affected, we’ll very quickly recalibrate thinking about what we’re doing,” he said. Few signs of ending and temperatures are expected to continue to climb after the warmest decade on record. “We would be extremely foolish, given all the evidence and the magnitude of this event, to just laugh it off as a one-off phenomenon,” Dr. Bradstock said. “I think we have to get ready to deal with a season like this again in the not-too-distant future.”	0
The chairman of the homebuilders association, Mr. Ugalde, said in his statement that the committee members selected by his organization were “not a block vote — they make their own decisions on how to vote.” In a blog post last year titled “Money in Your Pocket,” the association wrote that its success at keeping “costly provisions” out of the 2015 building code alone had saved homebuilders $1,000 per housing start. That figure, combined with other regulatory changes the group claimed credit for, “demonstrates just how much value NAHB delivers for members,” the association wrote. The effects of decisions like these will be felt for generations as global warming leads to more powerful storms and higher risk of damage to property. “Our definition of cost is what it costs the families when the home is built poorly,” said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, president of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, a consumer advocacy group. Those costs, she said, are more than financial and extend to the emotional and social burdens of a family being forced out of their home.	0
"A U.S. energy boom has helped make the country one of the world's biggest gas flarers. ""No-one has been able to fill the previous political leadership role on climate change that was played by the U.S. in the past,"" said Majid Jafar, chief executive of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum. If the world replaced all coal with gas, it would achieve the Paris climate target of by keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The problem is that the biggest coal consumers, China and India, would need incentives to switch from cheaper coal, he said. Birol also said coal-fired plants were the main global source of emissions."	1
“The U.S. approach incorporates the reality of the global energy mix and uses all energy sources and technologies cleanly and efficiently, including fossils fuels, nuclear energy, and renewable energy,” Mr. Pompeo said. Though American participation in the Paris Agreement will ultimately be determined by the outcome of the 2020 election, supporters of the pact say they have to plan for a future without American cooperation. Mr. Trump, who has mocked climate science as a hoax, will begin actively working against global efforts to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas. Keeping up the pressure for the kinds of economic change necessary to stave off the worse effects of planetary warming will be much harder without the world’s superpower. “Yes, there are conversations.	1
“To demonstrate our commitment to OSUN, we are contributing $1 billion to it,” he said. “But we can’t build a global network on our own; we will need partner institutions and supporters from all around the world to join us in this enterprise.” “I consider OSUN the most important and enduring project of my life and I should like to see it implemented while I am still around,” Soros said. Climate protection may become a matter of survival for Europe and the entire planet. “The question of being able to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement could become a question of survival,” Merkel said in a speech Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “That’s why there’s pressure to act.” The chancellor said the world needs to act together, but at the same time each country has to contribute to help make Europe become “climate neutral” by 2050.	0
Protestors including fellow Hollywood star Sally Field gathered at the U.S. Capitol building to seek a “just transition” for workers whose jobs will be impacted by the the move away from fossil fuels. Fonda helped kick off the rally by claiming that a transition to green energy will create million of jobs. The climate emergency requires us to rapidly transform our energy system and key industrial sectors in ways that protect workers and impacted communities. “Transforming our industrial base and energy systems can and will creation millions of good jobs. But we must ensure that they guarantee workers a living wage, a union wage, full benefits, a safe work place, and that they have a say in designing and full rights to collective bargaining.”	0
From 2013 to 2018, sales increased nearly 53 percent to almost $48 billion, according to the Organic Trade Association. That sounds like good news for the environment, but is it really? Agriculture, in general, is responsible for a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, farming accounts for roughly 9 percent of emissions. About half of those come from the soil.	1

As that ground thaws it releases that carbon into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. Researchers say that if too much permafrost thaws it will create a self-reinforcing cycle wherein thawing permafrost will lead to still more thawing permafrost, which in turn will make climate change worse. More carbon is being released than stored. “The key question really remains as to whether the measurements in Alaska over a several year period are representative of the broader Arctic system of other regions in the Arctic where permafrost exists,” said Matthew Druckenmiller, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder and one of the report’s editors. “If, in fact, it is, then we are seeing signs that the Arctic is really beginning to play that role as a large-scale feedback to the climate system.”	1
The reckoning is now unfolding as insurers strain to predict future losses, drop some of their most vulnerable customers, push for rate increases, fight with regulators and nervously watch what could become a third straight year of heavy losses. As terrifying as the threat of wildfires is, what happens after the fire is just as worrisome to climate adaptation experts. Even insurers are struggling to predict the risks associated with climate change. The consequences of that failure could be profound, experts say: The very industry that’s meant to stabilize society in the face of climate change is itself being destabilized by climate change, threatening to make it harder for people to cope with the rising tempo of disasters. The state’s homeowners insurers lost a total $20 billion in the 2017 and 2018 wildfires, according to an analysis published in October by Milliman, an actuary and consulting firm.	1
Arne Sorenson, the chief executive of Marriott, said the hotel chain was also feeling the brunt. “We have hotels in Puerto Rico that are still closed,” he said. Climate change could cause the next financial crisis. Mark Carney, the departing Bank of England governor who has spearheaded efforts to get central banks to carry out stress tests assessing climate impacts on sectors, said companies needed to examine and disclose their strategies and timelines for lowering their carbon footprints. “This is a whole-of-economy transition.	0
Under this initiative, 690 companies around the world, including 131 in the United States, have committed to set targets to reduce emissions in line with what science says will avoid the worst consequences of climate change. Walmart has committed to this goal. Businesses that embrace a high-efficiency, low-carbon model will have a better chance to survive and grow in the 21st century. Innovation is essential for any business, but especially in the face of the growing risks and uncertainty of climate change. Ultimately, tackling climate change goes beyond dollars and cents.	1
“It is their money that is fueling this crisis.” One measure of their effect on this high-level gathering was the kind of attention they received from the officials in attendance. President Trump earlier in the week obliquely referred to them as “the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers.” Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany urged world leaders on Thursday to “take the impatience of young people positively and constructively.” Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, said the youth movement had acted as “a very valuable nudge” to business and political leaders to transition away from a global economy driven by fossil fuels. No one can come to Davos anymore and not understand climate science. “You look stupid, frankly,” he said. “You can no longer ignore it.	1
Climate is always changing and humans are always adapting, writes Iceland’s former prime minister, so people should stop panicking over global warming. Some glaciers melt while others grow and it has been this way for all of history. “Our climate changes, but humans adapt.

Louise Farquharson, a geologist and researcher at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, studies the effect of climate change on permafrost. In the Arctic, ground can be permanently frozen from near the surface to several thousand feet deep. We see warming across the board, and generally the rate of warming is increasing. “But the impact varies significantly.” Her recent research found rapid thawing of permafrost high in the Canadian Arctic, where there is little surface vegetation to insulate the frozen ground. By 2016 the permafrost had already thawed at depths not expected until 2090 under a model of “moderate” global warming.	0
To combat the flames, tens of thousands of firefighters, most of them volunteers, have been called on to work long days over extended periods. Most of the fires have been caused by lightning strikes, though some people have misleadingly pointed to arson in an effort to minimize the links to climate change and the Australian government’s inaction on the issue. The drought is unrelated to climate change. “The wildfires decimating Australia, killing people, ravaging wild habitats and pushing communities and firefighters to their absolute limits are growing and coalescing into the country’s worst peacetime catastrophe precisely because of climate change,” said Paul Read, a co-director of the National Center for Research in Bushfire and Arson at Monash University in Melbourne. In Australia’s history, most bad fire seasons have coincided with the warming of an El Niño pattern.	2
"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its winter outlook that warmer-than-average temperatures are forecast for much of the U.S. this winter, with a wetter-than-normal season from December through February across the northern parts of the country.

A European tax on goods imported from the United States would be certain to exacerbate trade tensions with the Trump administration. But Europe has been threatening such a tax for years and, so far, has not followed through. The United States would still maintain a voice in international discussions on global warming. “We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters,” he said. “Just as we have in the past, the United States will continue to research, innovate, and grow our economy while reducing emissions and extending a helping hand to our friends and partners around the globe,” he said.	1
A local conservative politician described his own leader’s humiliation as “the welcome he probably deserved.” As Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, once observed, the collapse of the Soviet Union began with the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986.

The immense, still-unfolding tragedy of the Australian fires may yet prove to be the Chernobyl of climate crisis.	0
MADRID, Spain — Meet the Anti -Greta. Her name is Naomi Seibt, she’s 19 years old, but unlike some teenage activists we could mention she is most definitely not welcome at the UN’s COP25 climate conference. The global warming scare is a massive hoax. Worse — and being a German, she should know — Naomi believes that her Chancellor’s green policies are steering her country inexorably towards the kind of totalitarianism it last experienced in the 1930s and the 1940s. Naomi’s outspoken position on such issues as Angela Merkel’s disastrous immigration policy and climate change mark her as the kind of brave, independent-minded, intelligent teenager of whom any parent could be proud.	2

"You are failing us.” But young people like Thunberg lack the maturity and experience to make sense of this immensely complex issue. They are simply being used as ""human shields"" for adult climate activists who recognize that the climate scare will soon lose credibility as global warming Armageddon fails to materialize as forecast. The world may have already begun to cool in response to a weakening Sun, a phenomenon far more dangerous than any possible human-induced warming. In our August 20 America Out Loud article, The Disgraceful Use of Children to Promote the Climate Change Delusion, we explained: At the center of Baal was the human sacrifice of children to supposedly achieve some change in the weather.

Supporters of the plan also say that by 2032, the program could led to more than 1,000 fewer premature deaths, and more than 1,300 fewer cases of asthma, across the region. “Together we’ll address the climate crisis that’s already having increasingly large and damaging effects on every one of our communities,” said Kathleen A. Theoharides, the Massachusetts secretary of energy and environmental affairs. The things we do to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from transportation also deliver enormous benefits to public health and the economy. The cap-and-trade market for transportation reflects how policymakers have increasingly shifted their focus from the power sector — where natural gas and renewables have quickly replaced coal, helping energy companies to reduce their carbon footprints — toward transportation, where gasoline engines still dominate. The region’s cars, trucks and other forms of transport are now responsible for more than 40 percent of its greenhouse gas pollution, according to the Energy Information Administration.	0
It’s not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.” It is the third time in 40 years in which warming halted ozone depletion, as similar weather patterns led to unusually small ozone holes between 1988 and 2002, the Washington Post reported. “It’s a rare event that we’re still trying to understand,” Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with the Universities Space Research Association, said in a statement. These scientific events are not linked to climate change. The weather systems that disrupted the 2019 ozone hole, known as “sudden stratospheric warming” events, were 29 degrees higher than average. NASA said this weather event also helped to weaken the Antarctic polar vortex — a high speed of air which circles around the South Pole.	2
It’s when the skies might look clear but the levels of pollution are five to 10 times greater than normal.” A coalition of more than 20 medical groups, including the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, which represents 25,000 doctors and trainees, issued a statement last month declaring the high levels of particulate pollution in Sydney a “public health emergency” and calling on the government to address climate change. “The hazardous air pollution from the New South Wales bushfires is one of the ways people’s health is being harmed by climate change right now,” said Fiona Armstrong, executive director of the Climate and Health Alliance, an advocacy group in Australia. Southern Australia is likely to see an increased risk of fire as the world heats up as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. On Friday, smoke from fires in eastern Victoria had reached more than 100 miles west to Melbourne. To the east, hazy skies were reported across the Tasman Sea in New Zealand.	0
Ultimately, more atmospheric carbon dioxide has the same beneficial impact on farm production as it does in greenhouse growing facilities. Also, warmer temperatures bring longer growing seasons and fewer devastating frost events. Climate activists are telling tall tales when they assert that climate change is causing global or regional crop devastation. The proof is in the objective crop production data.

"""There is a huge climate-industrial complex benefitting from this, but it's not reducing emissions,"" he said. Even ""if the United States reduced its emissions to zero, it would have no impact on global warming, because Chinese emissions have gone up so rapidly."" American diplomacy can convince the communist country to buck its own self-interest in favor of global climate alarmism. Interestingly, Biden was the point person for the Obama administration's efforts on China, and he reportedly went soft on the Middle Kingdom while his son carried out massive deals with Chinese officials. So when Biden talks about holding China accountable, Americans can know just how that works out."	2

"At a climate summit in Madrid in December, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that 400 ppm had once been considered ""an unthinkable tipping point."" [nL8N28L35D] The last time there was a comparable concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was between 3 and 5 million years ago, when the temperature was between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius warmer and sea levels were 10 to 20 metres higher than today, scientists say. Although the data series started in 1958 has always shown CO2 concentrations increasing year-on-year, driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation, the rate of rise has not been perfectly even. Fluctations in the amount of CO2 absorbed by tropical forests and other natural carbon sinks can affect overall levels of the gas in the atmosphere.
