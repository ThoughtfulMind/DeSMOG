However, a new reckoning of the rising sea levels finds that previous calculations have have been off, and by quite a bit. The actual rise in sea levels measured only 1.2 millimeters instead of the previously accepted 1.6 to 1.9 millimeters. This, the researchers say, means that the actual rise has fallen from the once-imagined 6.7 inches over 90 years to 4.2 inches.	1
Claims of global warming have been greatly exaggerated. In 2012, The Economist called the Heartland Institute “the world’s most prominent think tank promoting skepticism about man-made climate change,” and this conference certainly lived up to that reputation.	2
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change should be clearer on how it draws conclusions from the body of research it assesses when gauging the impacts of global warming. Here’s an Associated Press summary in The Times and a BBC article on the Dutch findings, which are in a report initiated after an errant conclusion about the risks from rising sea levels in the Netherlands made it into the 2007 climate assessments by the panel.	1
Evidence now leans against global warming resulting from human-related greenhouse gas emissions. The report, which cites thousands of peer-reviewed articles the United Nations-sponsored panel on climate change ignored, also found that “no empirical evidence exists to substantiate the claim that 2°C of warming presents a threat to planetary ecologies or environments” and no convincing case can be made that “a warming will be more economically costly than an equivalent cooling.” The U.N.’s panel is scheduled to release its next report next month.	2
She shows me a picture she took of a flood gauge on an old wall in a town near the border of Germany and Austria. Flooding has been going on forever. “It is what it is.	2
In recent years, some scientists have begun to ask whether we can put some of that carbon back into the soil and into living ecosystems, like grasslands and forests. Simply reducing emissions will not sufficiently limit global warming. According to the 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an authority on climate science that operates under the auspices of the United Nations, humankind also needs to remove some of the carbon already in the atmosphere to avoid, say, the collapse of polar glaciers and the inundation of coastal cities worldwide.	0
'” Spencer then went on to illustrate how easy it is to make assumptions based on “data” by showing a graph on the screen that showed how the rise in UFO sightings coincided with the rise in ocean temperatures and joked that maybe aliens are causing global warming. Climate deniers blame global warming on aliens from outer space. The UFO joke graph was the first of a series of more serious graphs that Spencer presented to show that much of the alarmist rhetoric over global warming is not supported by facts.	1
I’m writing a series of posts building on this talk, which you’ll see here as I introduce some new directions for Dot Earth starting next month. Global warming is inevitably going to be, at best, managed . As I mentioned in my talk, it’s not hard to find signals that diplomatic and legislative efforts are destined to be inadequate and new approaches are needed.	0
One team that compiles the data includes Climate Professors John Christy and Roy Spencer at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, both of whom question Karl’s adjusted data. The study is one more example that you can get any answer you want when the thermometer data errors are larger than the global warming signal you are looking for. “We believe the satellite measurements since 1979 provide a more robust measure of global temperatures, and both satellite research groups see virtually the same pause in global temperatures for the last 18 years,” he said.	2
 FILE - In this Jan. 8, 2018 file photo taken with a drone shows the flooded village of Rees at river Rhine, Monday, Jan. 8, 2018. Millions more people around the world are threatened by river floods in coming decades due to climate change. Researchers in Germany say greater flood defenses are particularly needed in the United States, parts of India and Africa, Indonesia and Central Europe.	0
As the effects of global climate change become more pronounced, the number of displaced people will double, then triple, and possibly only continue to grow. Two billion people may be displaced by rising sea levels by the turn of the next century. Coastal peoples will press inland, while farmland off the coasts is likely to be increasingly compromised by drought and desertification.	0
About the record-breaking intensity of Hurricane Irma, Mr. Trump said that “we’ve had bigger storms than this.” And Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, took righteous exception to discussing the “cause and effect of these storms” as “very, very insensitive to the people in Florida.” Both were engaging in climate rejection rather than denial. Global warming is real and threatening. But there is good reason to believe that climate rejecters, including the president and Mr. Pruitt, are fighting a losing battle.	0
In this case, the origins of the spill are clear and unambiguous, the impacts graphic, and the whole environmental incident is easily understood. There is a danger that we can get used to global warming. Individuals 17 or under have grown up in a world where global climate change has always existed as a public concern.	0

The massive new iceberg, which would stretch from lower Manhattan up to Midtown in New York City, can be instructive to scientists and policy makers who are studying the impact of human actions on global sea-level rise. Global sea-level rise is both undeniable and consequential. “By capturing how it unfolds, we can see, first-hand, its breathtaking significance.” PAYPAL SLAMMED AFTER TELLING CUSTOMER THAT HER DEATH &apos;BREACHED ITS RULES&apos; When large chunks break off of glaciers, the process is known as calving.	0
12/24/09 to 1/4/10: According to polling by Yale and George Mason University, 80 percent of conservatives who followed the Climategate scandal say they now have less trust in scientists as a result. Global warming isn’t happening. Sixty-nine percent of all respondents who followed the story, and 94 percent of conservatives, agree with the statement that “scientists changed their results to make global warming appear worse than it is”—an allegation later shown to be completely false.	2
“We will wait until Congress has definitively said ‘No,’” Mr. Obama said, “before we say anything definitive about my executive authority here.” He added: “I’m not going to be forward leaning on what I can do without Congress before I’ve tested what I can do with Congress.” Mr. Obama said that the global climate deal that he helped to strike in Paris this month will survive intact no matter who follows him as president. You now have a global marketplace for clean energy that is stable and accelerating. He said that the great environmental victories of the previous 50 years were all accompanied by warnings from business interests that the new rules would ruin the economy, including efforts to clean the air, water and eliminate acid rain.	1
Instead, the site talks about air pollution, dirty energy, and green jobs. Fighting global warming, the stated purpose of AB32, is a loser with California voters. The League of Conservation Voters declares Prop 23 a “threat to California’s landmark air pollution standards.” This is nonsense.	1
A White House spokesman said in a statement that the discussion aimed to build on the administration’s efforts to promote fossil fuels at the G20 meeting this year. Fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future. As you can imagine, the BBC is very unhappy about this.	1
Have a listen and see whether he’s changed his tune on global warming. Humans have a role and therefore as a matter of prudence we ought to have less carbon loading of the atmosphere. 9:41 p.m. | Addenda | Jon Huntsman appears to join the climate shape shifters, according to NBC.	0
I recently interviewed Burton Richter, a physics Nobelist making a big push for a climate-friendly energy revolution, but also had an e-mail exchange earlier this year with Ivar Giaever, a winner of the physics Nobel who sees pronouncements of dangerous human-driven warming as more religious than scientific. The global warming has become a new religion. Please see the statement from the American Physical Society where it is stated: The evidence is incontrovertible; i.e.	2
The global warming crowd can’t get any crazier. Among frenzied climate watchers, cows have long been a suspicious bunch.	2
In their analysis published today in the journal Climatic Change, they found that Republicans living in Democratic-held congressional districts “tend to be somewhat more concerned with climate change.” In blue enclaves like New York City, Miami, San Francisco, and their surrounding areas, the number can soar to 66 percent. Global warming is mainly caused by human activity. Nationwide, only 31 percent of Republicans believe that greenhouse gas emissions are warming the planet, while 46 percent believe that climate change is caused naturally.	0
The Greenland fire evolution since July 29 as captured by @ESA_EO ‘s #sentinel2 pic.twitter.com/Iuk9blyui9 — Stef Lhermitte (@StefLhermitte) August 9, 2017 What’s striking about the Greenland fire is that it fits a larger trend of rapid change across the northern reaches of the planet. Across the entire Arctic, forests are burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years. By American standards, the Greenland fire is small, covering around 1,200 acres (about two square miles)—about the size of midtown Manhattan.	1
Putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions would be central for getting global warming under control. More than 40 governments around the world, including the European Union and California, have now put a price on carbon, either through direct taxes on fossil fuels or through cap-and-trade programs.	0
More than 97 percent of the papers stating a cause for warming, the authors found, pointed to humans. Humans are causing global warming. (Read my e-mail exchange with two authors for more background.)	0
In fact, a recent study found that the world is getting too fat because there is too much food available! There’s no sign of global warming hurting productivity yet. “But the IPCC – which seems to be immune from facts – continues to insist that global warming is hurting our crops… when there’s really no observational evidence for it.	2
The net effect will be a general and global warming of the earth. None suggest that it will be a minor effect, to be ignored while we go about our business.	0
Patrick Moore, a Canadian ecologist and business consultant who was a member of Greenpeace from 1971-86, told members of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee environmental groups like the one he helped establish use faulty computer models and scare tactics in promoting claims man-made gases are heating up the planet. There is no scientific proof that human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) are the dominant cause of the minor warming of the Earth’s atmosphere over the past 100 years. Even if the planet is warming up, Moore claimed it would not be calamitous for men, which he described as a “subtropical species.” Skeptics of manmade climate change say there is no evidence the Earth is warming.	2
Here’s Huybers: There’s a reporting bias. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is going to go unstable. I just was involved in writing a paper that said we don’t really know and here are some issues, and it’ll be published somewhere else and that’s fine.	0
The carbon emissions of burning witches haven’t been studied carefully enough yet. The data isn’t lining up with the Church of Global Warming. That lowest circle of climate hell is reserved for Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, and Mike Huckabee, and of course the infamous heretic James Inhofe in the Senate category.	2
(He reprises his geo-engineering push in a forthcoming issue of Time Magazine.) A modest carbon tax could pay for all of this work at a fraction the cost of a cap on emissions of greenhouse gases, the approach pursued by Europe under the Kyoto Protocol (and rejected in the United States). Does the film succeed?	1
Dyson’s refusal ever to accommodate himself with the modish notions of the hour may explain why, unlike some of his less distinguished and brilliant contemporaries over the years, he has never been awarded a Nobel Prize. I am hoping that the scientists and politicians who have been blindly demonizing carbon dioxide for 37 years will one day open their eyes and look at the evidence.	2
The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has never been higher. This was the most recent environmental milestone in a year that has been marked by the Trump administration dismantling many Obama-era environmental policy initiatives.	0
Among frenzied climate watchers, cows have long been a suspicious bunch. The earth’s cattle population actually produces more carbon dioxide than automobiles, planes, and all other forms of transport combined. Moreover, the cow pies they drop and the wind they break produce a third of the world’s twenty-times-more-detrimental methane emissions.	1
According to a study by the nonprofit Forest Trends, in 2016, $662 million globally went toward the purchase of carbon offsets for the protection or restoration of forests and other natural landscapes. For-profit carbon project developers work with landowners to qualify large forests for credits. Doubters have questioned whether city trees offer enough scale to be worthwhile, McPherson noted.	1
"However, it disappeared for several decades before showing back up, throwing a huge kink in many scientific explanations for its existence. At that time, the scientific community had just launched the first satellites that provided images of the sea-ice cover from space.

For the first time, a few of its 2019 Iran itineraries will have no flights at all; Mr. Barnes said that travelers will use overnight trains instead. Air travel produces far more carbon emissions than train travel. Then there’s Roar Africa, a specialist in luxury Africa vacations.	1
From the numbers in your article, it looks like there has been quite a lot of increase in urban area. The increase in extreme flood likelihood will occur prior to reaching 73-percent urbanization because of changes in climate. While I argue for newer, updated modeling, I also jump to what we can do in terms of engineering to reduce major flooding.	0
They found that in all 13 cases, for floods of the same flow rate, water heights post-levee were higher than pre-levee—in one instance by more than 5 feet. The study used real-world data to show what actually happened during floods, instead of relying on a model of what “should” happen. Scientists say stream gauges near every levee could serve as a warning system, indicating which levees worsen flooding and delivering a reality check on the Corps’ design predictions.	1
There’s still hope for Planet Earth. Global warming is occurring more slowly than computer models forecast a decade ago. The study, published in the journal Nature Geoscience, does not contradict the scientists’ concerns that global warming is dramatically damaging the environment, but it does suggest that it’s not too late to do something about it.	2
The poll also found that those who believed in global warming remained roughly the same, but those who were undecided dropped six percentage points, leading to the conclusion that many of those who were once vacillating now disbelieve global warming. Human emissions of greenhouse gases are causing global warming. But 37% of Americans say that nature itself is responsible.	0
We are going to be seeing reports like this for the next 20 years. The value of a global push to limit the human contribution to warming exceeds the economic value of abundant fossil energy. Keith Bradsher’s article on China’s energy concerns trumping its climate worries provides supporting evidence.	0
Before we move onto the threadbare science in Parker’s arguments, let’s just first marvel at the way she has tried to blame Breitbart for something it did not do. Global warming is not expected to end anytime soon. Though we would prefer to focus on our usual coverage of weather and climate science, in this case we felt it important to add our two cents — especially because a video clip from weather.com (La Niña in Pacific Affects Weather in New England) was prominently featured at the top of the Breitbart article.	0
This would create economic incentives for shippers to adopt new fuels and technologies, which are likely to be costly. A clear switch away from fossil fuels is now on the cards. We call these features “One Thing You Can Do.” In fact, there are a lot of things you can do.	1
Finally, there are basic questions about the robustness of the conclusions, which are based on a new line of genetic analysis not previously applied to polar bears. This work bolsters the view of scientists who’ve been calling for a conservation strategy for polar bears and other ice-dependent species focused on areas of the Arctic where sea ice is projected to endure well into this greenhouse-heated era. Watch this presentation.]	1
In coming centuries, I believe we’ll strive to make the anthropocene comfortable for as many species as possible, if only for the selfish reason that it will make us comfortable too. In the very act of inventing tools to improve the environment, we will come closer to understanding our place on the planet, as well as in a global society of creatures like ourselves. By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion.	1
[Video: Arctic Sea Ice Continues To Thin] In the past decade, the Arctic ice-cap extent has bobbed back and forth among top 10 record lows, all the while continuing an overall steady decline that started in the 1970s. Since 1978, the winter Arctic ice cap has shrunk by 12 percent per decade. The lowest winter maximum on record occurred in 2011, when the sea ice extended 5.65 million square miles (14.63 million square km).	1
Indeed, the central premise of the Lancet commission’s work is that tackling climate change could be the single greatest health opportunity of the 21st century. Climate change has the potential to set back global health. The greenhouse gas emissions that are warming our planet come from industrial activity that pollutes our air and water, and the temperature changes may lead to drought that brings malnutrition.	0
The Coalition’s new white paper, Carbon Dioxide Benefits the World: See for Yourself, reviews the current state of climate science with particular attention to its biological impact. Global temperature increases have been far, far less than doomsday computer models predicted – about three times smaller. Not only has this warming been small, but there is no real reason to think it’s harmful.	2
Believers also insist there is a “consensus” that manmade global warming is likely to prove dangerous. Recent global warming is not only manmade but dangerous. Millions die worldwide every year because they do not have cheap, clean, continuous, low-tech, coal-fired power.	0
The melting seen in West Antarctica and the Antarctica Peninsula account for about four-fifths of the ice loss. Global sea levels have risen approximately 8 inches over the past century, with sea-level rises getting higher in some parts of the globe. Coastal areas, such as Florida, Bangladesh and cities like London and Shanghai are at risk.	1
President Obama, who regards tackling climate change as a central element of his legacy, spoke of the deal in a televised address from the White House. This agreement sends a powerful signal that the world is fully committed to a low-carbon future. “We’ve shown that the world has both the will and the ability to take on this challenge.” Scientists and leaders said the talks here represented the world’s last, best hope of striking a deal that would begin to avert the most devastating effects of a warming planet.	1
Instead they should talk about stuff that tugs at the heart strings, like cancer, kids with asthma, and “25,000 people dying every day from pollution.” This is what Arnold Schwarzenegger told a meeting at the UN’s climate conference in Bonn, Germany. People do not focus as much on 2 degrees energy increases in temperatures or increases in sea levels rising. And in propaganda terms, he is absolutely right.	1
Update, 3:53 p.m. | I just recalled that my old friend Mike Lemonick wrote an excellent piece in 2012 for Climate Central focused on the response of coastal communities in Florida to sea-level realities. Global warming is really such a big deal. “I tell them, ‘the ocean is rising,’ ” he said.	0
But some scientists said the difference could be much larger. China had released about 900 million metric tons more carbon dioxide from 2011 to 201. That would be an 11 percent increase in emissions, he said.	1
Millions of tons of methane are frozen in Arctic permafrost, both on land and in the seafloor. Rapid warming in the Arctic could upset these deposits, melting them and freeing the gas. This would boost the planet&apos;s greenhouse gas levels and could accelerate climate change.	0
We get back to core stuff.” Recent research seems to confirm the findings. Fossil fuel emissions hit an all-time high in 2017 as carbon dioxide emissions surged for the first time in three years. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions—greenhouse gases that each trap 30 and 300 times more heat than carbon dioxide—are also on the rise, European Union scientists said last month.	1
Perhaps most confusingly, 36 percent of Republicans nationwide believe that global warming will harm people in the United States, but only 32 percent are worried about it. Global warming will harm Americans. By contrast, overwhelming majorities of Democratic voters in all states are worried about global warming and believe that manmade activities, such as burning fossil fuels, are to blame.	0
Efforts to undermine science education are often related to adoption of the new standards. Human activity has increased carbon dioxide emissions and affected the climate. In Wyoming, lawmakers passed a statute banning public schools from teaching climate change is caused by humans, though that was later repealed.	0
They might help the human species go to “risk school.” But, as I explained to Gell-Mann then, I don’t see better communication, on its own, being remotely sufficient to set the world on a course to shift swiftly from the fuels of convenience — coal and oil — even as human numbers and resource appetites crest. If the media put global warming front and center on nightly newscasts and front pages and homepages, people would line up to fight the climate crisis. The challenge, of course, is that a science-based definition of the “climate crisis” (I still think that climate scientist Richard Somerville defined that term best in a 2007 debate with Michael Crichton and others) is not the kind of message that will get people rushing to the ramparts.	0
Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have found to their surprise that despite the increased human emissions of greenhouse gases, between 2002 and 2014, plants were somehow able to absorb more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than in previous decades. Terrestrial ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and offset a large fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. “That portion that stays in the atmosphere — that’s called the airborne fraction,” said Trevor Keenan, one of the report’s authors, “has reduced by about 20% over the last 15 years.” Not only that, over the past 50 years, “the amount of CO2 absorbed by the oceans and terrestrial biosphere annually has more than doubled,” the report states, and “global warming over vegetated land notably slowed since the start of the twenty-first century.” Since the start of the twenty-first century, the researchers state, “the airborne fraction has been declining (−2.2% per year), despite the rapid increase in anthropogenic emissions.” The decline is clearly visible in this accompanying chart, which shows the airborne fraction dropping after 2002 and breaking with the historical upward trend.	1
On the other hand, NASA calculated if the temperature contributions of El Nino and El Nina were removed from the global data through the years, 2017 would go down as the hottest year on record, NASA chief climate scientist Gavin Schmidt said. Carbon pollution is like putting the Earth on an escalator of rising temperatures, with natural variation such as El Nino or the cooling effect of volcanoes like hopping up or down a step or two on that escalator. Not every year will be warmer than the last because of natural variations, but the trend over years will be rising temperatures, they said.	0
The new Stanford/Reuters poll shows that the public is more convinced than ever that climate warming is happening and LESS convinced that humans are to blame. Global warming will never hurt anyone. Just 1% of Tea Partiers think that there is a more than 80% chance that humans are primarily to blame for climate change (ie, an IPCC-like statement of attribution).	2
Similarly wide-ranging effects are likely in humans as well, and PCBs can increase the likelihood of various health problems, including cancer, EPA studies have shown. If human-driven climate change continues on the present course, the ice covering the site could begin to melt in about 75 years. It would be much longer before the base itself would become exposed, but in the meantime, meltwater could move through the ice, saturating structures in the base and carrying toxic waste with it as it flows to the coast, they said.	0
Coleman insists that there is no credible evidence of man-made warming, nor has there ever been. The theory that carbon dioxide is a pollutant has not been substantiated scientifically. “There has been no warming over 18 years,” Coleman said.	2
Nothing I, or anyone else writes, will change the reality that the gas age is here for many years to come. Progress in avoiding environmental regrets can come through constructive discussion of ways to cut risks and waste and to sustain a long-term energy quest that extends beyond fossil fuels even while they remain abundant and cheap. That’s no easy task.	0
Most global warming is natural and even if there had been no Industrial Revolution current global temperatures would be almost exactly the same as they are now. The paper, by Australian scientists John Abbot and Jennifer Marohasy, published in GeoResJ uses the latest big data technique to analyse six 2,000 year-long proxy temperature series from different geographic regions.	2
“It sort of saps your emotional reserves,” she says, “this constant background feeling of anxiety.” Forty percent of Americans reported hearing about climate change in the media at least once a month in 2015, and about half said they were worried about the topic that year, making it “a powerful environmental stressor,” according to a 2016 federal report. And that’s not the only way global warming causes psychological problems. Research suggests that heat waves affect our neural regulation, weakening our ability to regulate our emotions, and that people are more aggressive and less empathetic during warm periods.	0
The release below, on work clarifying what did — and didn’t — contribute to the extraordinary snows of last winter is a prime example of a solid, contextualized account. The winter conditions either debunked or supported the picture of human-driven global warming. Converging Weather Patterns Caused Last Winter’s Huge Snows A Warming World Can Still See Severe Storms The memory of last winter’s blizzards may be fading in this summer’s searing heat, but scientists studying them have detected a perfect storm of converging weather patterns that had little relation to climate change.	1

As a consequence, a significant fraction of the multi-year ice has surface emissivity signatures of first-year ice.” Yet more evidence of the hazards of putting too much emphasis on a particular paper, perhaps (in other words, supporting Dr. Betts’ point). Ice volume is a better measure than ice area. Again, I’d love you to ask your leading cryosphere scientists whether the dramatic melting we’ve seen in recent years would have occurred absent the long-term warming trend.	1
The sense of urgency has been highlighted by a series of sobering reports released by scientists over the past year. The world has little more than a decade to limit catastrophic climate change, which will involve millions of people displaced by sea level rise or subjected to deadly heatwaves, as well as the loss of almost all of the planet’s coral reefs. About two-thirds of Americans believe that global warming is influencing the weather, in the wake of a string of deadly extreme events in the US.	0
Additionally, 48% of U.S. Catholics consider global warming to be a very serious problem, while 46% of the general public believes the same. There is no solid evidence of global warming. The survey demonstrates that global warming is a highly politicized issue that breaks U.S. Catholics down along the lines of their political parties, as well as their race and ethnicity.	2
It’ll also make it harder for a possible future Abbott government to roll back the scheme. People will need to see that no catastrophes eventuate on the day the carbon price comes in. 2.	1
“We have tremendous natural resources, from coal to natural gas to oil, to generate electricity in a very cost-effective way,” Mr. Pruitt told the conference. Global warming is occurring. “There’s a debate in the United States between the denialists who pooh-pooh any thought about climate change and the catastrophic dangers it portends, and those who agree with the scientific academies of every country in the world that we’re facing an existential threat and we have to do something about it,” Governor Brown said Saturday.	0
Summary statements are phrased to give the impression of greater certainty and larger impacts than either the text of the report or the earlier FAR support. There is low confidence in attribution of drought on a global scale to human influence on climate. As another example, the report discusses how changes in the El Nino weather phenomenon and in ocean currents have contributed to recent extreme weather events.	2

Even Big Oil has begun lobbying for a carbon fee. The world will soon do something about global warming. The majority of Americans and economists also support a carbon fee.	0
Er, not quite, no, as this exquisitely damning rebuttal from the Global Warming Policy Forum makes clear. Far from staying flat since 1998, global temperatures have carried on rising. It’s just that scientists haven’t noticed before because they’ve been looking in the wrong place – on land, rather than in the sea where all the real heat action is happening.	0
"But people should still be concerned about global warming, Fitzpatrick says.

 This color-coded map displays global temperature anomaly data from 2014. Global temperatures in 2014 shattered earlier records, making 2014 the hottest year since record-keeping began in 1880. Every continent set heat records last year, and the Pacific Ocean was unusually warm despite a no-show El Niño.	0
A 2013 analysis at the New York Times described air travel as “the most serious environmental sin” committed by the Little People. One round-trip flight from New York to Europe or to San Francisco creates a warming effect equivalent to 2 or 3 tons of carbon dioxide per person. “The average American generates about 19 tons of carbon dioxide a year; the average European, 10.” President Obama swanned off to Paris on the most fabulous private jet in the world, Air Force One, which burns about 5 gallons of jet fuel for every mile it covers.	0
It became clear early in Donald Trump’s presidency that many of his top officials shared a common trait: They were climate deniers. Carbon dioxide is not a “primary contributor” to global warming. Nine months into Trump’s presidency, he continues to nominate climate deniers to key spots in his administration.	2
So-called “renewable” energy is cripplingly expensive to the customer but is often unprofitable even after massive subsidies from taxpayers. Europe is suffering from political rejection of fossil fuels. Theirs is not an example the U.S. should wish to follow.	1
The three R’s of adaptation — resistance, resilience, retreat — are very likely to be increasingly in play. Texas can accept that sea level is rising. We need to do research on more extreme measures (see Task Force On Climate Remediation Research).	1
“One round-trip flight from New York to Europe or to San Francisco creates a warming effect equivalent to 2 or 3 tons of carbon dioxide per person,” the NYT estimated. The average American generates about 19 tons of carbon dioxide a year. Aviation fuel supposedly releases about 21 pounds of carbon into the atmosphere per gallon, which means President Obama’s 7,656-mile round-trip to Paris will burn 38,280 gallons of fuel, and fart a whopping 803,880 pounds of carbon into the biosphere.	1

Most scientists, politicians and journalists have learned that they will have a quieter life if they just drift along with what most scientists privately concede is sheer exaggeration. Global warming is likely to prove dangerous. 10: Given that the authors of the largest ever survey of peer-reviewed opinion in learned papers marked only 64 of 11,944 papers, or 0.5%, as stating they agreed with the official “consensus” proposition that recent warming was mostly manmade, on what rational, evidence-based, scientific ground is it daily asserted that “97% of scientists” believe recent global warming is not only manmade but dangerous?	0
A diet heavy on vegetables is the best diet for the planet in this age of global warming. The 32-year-old federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee has decided to add global warming to its criteria for proper nutrition and has determined that meat should be removed from our diets to help environmental sustainability.	0
The disagreement comes only over Berkeley Earth’s use of a simple model fitting the temperature record for the past 250 years to human CO2 emissions and volcanoes to conclude that the best explanation for the observed warming is greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide is responsible for the warming. While the Berkeley Earth team values the simplicity of the model (indeed, in physics the simple model is generally considered the best), Curry is not convinced and thinks it is overly simplistic.	0
Here’s her note: The work pointing to periods of recovery on the way to a largely ice-free summer later in the century is still valid…. Natural variability is large for sea ice. When this reinforces the anthropogenic change, it can cause RILEs [rapid ice loss events] — but it can also counter that change and cause brief periods of near-stability (or even small increases on a decadal scale).	1
Meanwhile, Trump’s announcement also has supporters of the Paris agreement concerned about its effects on K-12 education. Global warming is due in large part to human activity. Loewus reports that Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, says Trump’s decision to withdraw from the climate agreement will not lead to changes for teachers who are already teaching that climate change is caused by humans.	0
Rainfall trends have changed little since the 1970s. Sea level rise is accelerating. There is no evidence at all for this.	1
Global emissions continue to rise, albeit slowly. A mammoth effort is needed, beginning now and carrying through the century, to decarbonize global energy systems. The next 10 years are absolutely crucial: Emissions will have to be on a sharp downward path by 2030 for any hope of success.	0
The center is supported by the United Nations tourism organization and the Jamaica Tourist Board, and its chairman, Edmund Bartlett, said that its mission is to conduct research on destination preparedness, management and recovery from events — like recent hurricanes — that disrupt tourism. There appears to be hope for travel and tourism to continue to grow in the wake of global warming. “The travel world isn’t ignoring the severity of climate change,” Ms. Redman of Greenpeace said.	1
They contain enough ice to raise global sea level by 4 feet (1.2 meters) and are melting faster than most scientists had expected. These findings will require an upward revision to current predictions of sea level rise. “This sector will be a major contributor to sea level rise in the decades and centuries to come,” Rignot said.	1
President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency in both North and South Carolina, and a Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator said that the Category 4 hurricane will likely cause “massive damage to our country.” And the rise in sea levels, experts say, is making the storm surge worse. Sea level rise is a direct consequence of global warming. Since 1950, the sea level has risen 6.5 inches—a number that sounds small but has actually had major consequences across the country.	0
PHILIP STOTT: I don‘t disagree with it. Global warming is not a crisis. BRIAN LEHRER: Michael Crichton, you‘re shaking your head no?	2
Here’s Scientific American failing to be scientific. More warming leads to more fires, which release more carbon, which causes more warming, and so on. The truth of course, is rather different The fires have nothing to do with “climate change.” They were a weather event – not a climate event.	0
The carbon regulations are unconstitutional. The rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, would enforce a 32 percent reduction on greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by 2030 (compared with 2005 levels).	2
There’s some hope for a different threatened species, however. Coral reefs may be more resilient to global warming and bleaching than we think. Check out her piece to learn more, and have a great week!	1
As temperatures rise, water molecules expand, also contributing to sea level rise. Much of the rise in sea level we’ve seen since the 1880s is the result of thermal expansion. Melting glaciers, though, can worsen the situation.	1
The odds for human extinction because of climate change or global warming are 50 percent or more. But the majority of Americans, or 58 percent, think the odds of human extinction because of climate change is less than 50 percent, revealing that climate change is not a topic of universal agreement in the United States.	0
Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries. Climate change, rising atmospheric carbon dioxide, excess nutrient inputs, and pollution in its many forms are fundamentally altering the chemistry of the ocean, often on a global scale and, in some cases, at rates greatly exceeding those in the historical and recent geological record. Major observed trends include a shift in the acid-base chemistry of seawater, reduced subsurface oxygen both in near-shore coastal water and in the open ocean, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increase in mercury and persistent organic pollutants.	0
Even if the planet is warming up, Moore claimed it would not be calamitous for men, which he described as a “subtropical species.” Skeptics of manmade climate change say there is no evidence the Earth is warming. Global surface temperatures have not increased for the past 15 years. The 2,200-page new Technical Report attributes that to a combination of several factors, including natural variability, reduced heating from the sun and the ocean acting like a “heat sink” to suck up extra warmth in the atmosphere.	2
The good news is that the uplift of supporting bedrock could make the remaining ice sheets more stable. In recent years, the rising earth has probably skewed satellite measurements of ice loss, leading researchers to underestimate the rate of vanishing ice by as much as 10 percent. [Images of Melt: Earth&apos;s Vanishing Ice] Interplay between bedrock and mantle in Antarctica is just one of the many geologic processes that happen all over our dynamic planet.	1
Large chunks of the polar ice disintegrated then, and scientists have established that the sea level rose 20 to 30 feet. Humanity is about to cause an equal or greater rise in sea level. The new paper argues that it could happen far more rapidly, with the worst case being several feet of sea-level rise over the next 50 years, followed by increases so precipitous that they would force humanity to beat a hasty retreat from the coasts.	0
By removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it as carbon in soil, branches, and tree trunks, forest have historically worked as a “carbon sink” for the state. California’s forests emitted more carbon than they sequestered. Wildfires accelerate this process.	1
"This process is known as ""soil respiration,"" and it&apos;s an important complement to photosynthesis — the process by which plants turn CO2, water and light into energy — helping to keep ecosystems around the world running smoothly. As global temperatures rise, microbes in the soil have been releasing CO2 faster than plants can snatch it up again. Previous studies have indicated that tree roots and certain microbes both respire more frequently at higher temperatures (up until a certain point, when the intense heat causes the organisms to stop functioning completely)."	1
We also used the latest available estimates for the global warming potential of methane, while Cathles relied on older and lower values. For most uses, the GHG footprint of shale gas is greater than that of other fossil fuels on time scales of up to 100 years. When used to generate electricity, the shale-gas footprint is still significantly greater than that of coal at decadal time scales but is less at the century scale.	1
But sometimes that dam bursts as the polar vortex weakens and allows cold air to escape the Arctic to more temperate climes. Because of climate change the warming Arctic is weakening the polar vortex. Researchers are still figuring out how the warming Arctic is triggering the polar vortex’s aberrant behavior.	0
So, what do we really know about it? Global warming might be caused by some combination of human activity and Mother Nature. “I have to admit,” Spencer said, “adding Co2 to the atmosphere should cause some warming, but I think it’s an entirely open question… how much warming we’re going to get from adding Co2 to the atmosphere.” And this factor “makes all the difference between Al Gore’s Armageddon and ‘who cares it’s probably a beneficial thing.	1
Nobody is playing for second place. The nation that leads the clean energy economy is likely to lead the global economy. And if we fail to recognize that same imperative, we risk falling behind.	1
So we should have the same target but different models of social and governance networks on this kind of issue.” Geels went on to warn about relying to much on market tools like a carbon price, saying policies fostering innovation need to be ramped up and governments must acknowledge the need to compensate losers. Exclusive emphasis on a carbon price is a delusion. [Inserted 1:55 p.m.| On that same panel, Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution, who works both on climate science and clean energy technology, said science can do far more than characterize the climate problem: “The climate community has focused a lot on presenting the vision of the future we’re trying to avoid.	2
Power lines also start sagging in the heat and can short out if they touch the ground or nearby foliage. Global warming could increase these risks in the future. Some possible solutions?	0
Yet as the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has noted, many of the recent climatological events and trends “can be explained by the natural variability of the climate system,” without excluding an indeterminate influence from atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. Better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming. Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsrome.	2
For instance, he believes that climate change has increased the chance of the heat wave in Southern California 20 to 50 times over. Of course, the strongest evidence for global warming isn’t isolated events like particularly hot days. Rather, it’s an ever-growing compendium of global climate data showing consistent, undeniable trends.	1
Climate change is real. We must wean ourselves off fossil fuels. So what are the alternatives?	1
Global warming is a myth the greenies’ heads exploded. Since then, that figure has risen to 400 scientific papers.	2
Here’s how he describes it on his blog. There appears to have been little or no change in globally averaged temperature over the last two decades. Because of this, we are getting a lot of questions along the lines of “I saw this plot on a denialist web site.	2
A landmark United Nations report from last year warned that the world has little more than a decade to limit catastrophic climate change, which will involve millions of people displaced by sea level rise or subjected to deadly heatwaves, as well as the loss of almost all of the planet’s coral reefs. Global warming is influencing the weather, in the wake of a string of deadly extreme events in the US. About half say the disastrous wildfires in California and Hurricanes Florence and Michael, which flattened parts of North Carolina and Florida, were worsened because of rising global temperatures.	0
“The focus of this effort must be on developing and deploying technologies that reduce [greenhouse gases] while making sure that energy remains reliable and affordable.” The utility has urged the Trump administration to reverse power plant rules enacted by President Barack Obama to cut back emissions. The benefits of carbon dioxide outweigh the environmental costs. “Southern Company would seem to be the individual company that’s the most Exxon-like,” Anderson said.	2
In any case, whether or not there was a pause in warming for a dozen years or so has no bearing on the underlying scientific validity of climate change. The findings do not undermine global warming theory. Besides, record global temperatures for 2014 and 2015 suggest that warming has resumed.	1
If you stop tilling to increase soil carbon, for example, but use more herbicides because you have more weeds, then you probably haven’t changed your overall emissions profile, he says. The climate-mitigation potential of carbon farming has been greatly oversold. Williams has reduced his herbicide use, not increased it, but Schlesinger’s broader point — about the need for a careful overall accounting of greenhouse gases — is important.	2
New York is among the most progressive states in the country on climate change according to polling data. Global warming is happening. Eighty-six percent of New Yorkers backed funding research into renewable energy, 81 percent supported regulating carbon dioxide as a pollutant, and 79 percent called for strict emission limits on coal-fired power plants.	0
He penned a piece published on June 22 in EcoWatch in which he bashes “American conservatism” and positions the papal publication as being responsible for a “new dynamism” that he calls “palpable.” “It is more a gale than a fresh breeze,” Pope exclaimed, “when the most ground-breaking pope since John XXIII links poverty and climate.” In his post titled “How Pope Francis’s Climate Encyclical Is Disrupting American Politics,” Pope pronounces: “Something fundamental is shifting this summer in political and cultural attitudes around the climate.” The former Sierra Club director then goes into a litany of news stories to support his position. After the most extensive and expensive global propaganda campaign, fewer people worry about a warming planet than did 25 years ago. Nor does he acknowledge that, according to the Harvard Political Review, the vast majority of Americans—even those who agree that “global warming is a proven fact and is mostly caused by emissions from cars and industrial facilities such as power plants”—remain “unsupportive of government measures to prevent climate change that might harm the economy.” And “harm the economy” it does—which is why, despite the G7 non-binding “agreement,” many European counties are returning to fossil fuels and retreating from renewables—led by German capacity payments to keep coal-fueled power plants open.	2
"That also proved wrong. But people should still be concerned about global warming. ""The paper in no way diminishes the extensive body of observations that global warming is happening and that it is largely due to human activity,"" she added."	0
But we don’t know that yet. Human activity is primarily responsible for the rise in carbon dioxide emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the top climate-science body at the United Nations, calls carbon dioxide the biggest heat-trapping force and says that it is responsible for about 33 times more added warming than natural causes.	0
Since we the voters have accepted our guilt, our democratically elected governments have too – and when governments see guilt, they see crime. The whole world will be devastated if we don’t stop burning fossil fuels immediately (if not sooner, since some say it’s too late and the world is already doomed). With the world’s fate on the line, people in government are understandably trying their damnedest to save us – by such things as keeping our scientists all in a row.	0
Carbon dioxide is a threat to public health. Moreover, it is necessary to undo the finding to prevent climate-change advocates from mounting legal challenges preventing the implementation of any executive orders on EPA regulations issued by President Donald Trump.	0
Yet that dataset, which, like all the surface datasets, was recently adjusted to deliver the global warming that measurements did not show, now indicates a warming trend over those same eight years at a rate equivalent to more than 1.5 degrees/century. There had been no global warming this millennium, and why, though the two satellites continue to show little or no warming. 3: Why do all the datasets, surface as well as satellite, show a lot less warming than predicted?	2
“It’s been described as rotten.” The Arctic is heading toward irreversible melting and ecosystem destruction, according to the annual Arctic Report Card released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Arctic has lost nearly 95 percent of its oldest ice. On top of that, the once-pristine region is becoming quite dirty: In addition to a growing toxic algae problem, the Arctic Ocean now has the highest concentration of microplastics of any ocean on Earth.	1
The only thing that comes to mind is the government needs to have its own power company,” Bruenig said. The world must halve global emissions or face cataclysmic global warming. But the paper goes beyond that goal, proposing lifting the geographical limitations on the TVA to create what would essentially function as a national power company and suggesting a means by which to pay for what would likely be a costly overhaul.	0
To be clear, while mainstream climate science is replete with published proxy temperature studies showing that temperatures have cycled up and down over the last 2,000 years – spiking during the Medieval Warm Period and then again recently to about 1980 as shown in Figure 12 – the official IPCC reconstructions (which underpin the Paris Accord) deny such cycles. There is something unusual about current temperatures: that we have catastrophic global warming from industrialisation. In our new paper in GeoResJ, we not only use the latest techniques in big data to show that there would very likely have been significant warming to at least 1980 in the absence of industrialisation, we also calculate an Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) of 0.6°C.	0
The Disengaged would most like to ask whether global warming is actually occurring, and what harm it will cause. Global warming is happening and is caused by human activities. Scientific Agreement: While approximately 97% of publishing climate scientists agree that climate change is occurring and that it is caused primarily by human activities, this high level of scientific agreement is understood by only 44 percent of the Alarmed, 18 percent of the Concerned, 12 percent of theCautious, and 5 percent or fewer of the Disengaged, Doubtful and Dismissive.	0
At least one prominent study concluded that U.S. efforts to reduce emissions resulted mostly from economic decline, not other efforts. Global trade merely outsourced U.S. emissions. In the meantime, some climate deniers — including some in the Trump administration — have seized on earlier reports of dropping emissions to argue that aggressive U.S. emissions controls aren’t necessary.	1
You can imagine how difficult it is to infer long-term trends over the past 100 years when 40 years of data are missing.” She says other studies agree with the PSMSL adjustments: “At least one study using [approximately] 20 gauges in the northern Indian Ocean, for example, found that regional sea level rise rates were on par with the global average.” Sea level change varies a lot around the world. Worldwide sea levels rose over the last two decades by about a foot per century. However, the U.N. notes that some parts of the world, such as the coast of California, saw sea levels fall.	1
THIS COFFIN-SHAPED ICEBERG IS HEADED TO DIE The ice sheet originally disappeared approximately 125,000 years ago, the study noted, and found that sea levels were more than 19 feet (6 meters) above present levels. Climate change has caused more than 3 trillion tons of ice to melt from Antarctica over the past 25 years ago, according to a USA Today report. In September, NASA unveiled its new $1 billion satellite, ICESat-2, to give humanity a stronger, data-backed vision of exactly how fast Earth’s ice is melting.	1
Kivalina may face changes due to nature, but not because of fossil fuels. Glaciers are melting at a pace unprecedented in modern times During his Alaska trip. Historians, geologists, Park employees, and glaciologists have been keeping track of glaciers for hundreds of years, and the records for Exit Glacier are no exception.	1
Picking a target doesn’t mean all is lost if you don’t make it, but it helps to know what you’re shooting for. Carbon emissions are growing exponentially. Any reduction in the growth rate of emissions (let alone stabilizing or reducing emissions) greatly puts off the day when we hit a trillion tonnes, and allows time for development of technology allowing a more permanent fix.	1
We have been through wars on poverty, drugs, cancer and even Christmas. Global warming is like a world war. “It is a world war.” War rhetoric serves a valuable function.	0
 File photo - A surfer drops in on a large wave at Praia do Norte, in Nazare Dec. 11, 2014. A massive outpouring of carbon dioxide from the deep ocean may have helped end the last ice age. There is strong evidence that changes in Earth&apos;s orbit set the pace of the planet&apos;s ice ages, by altering how much sunlight reaches the Northern Hemisphere.	1
Warming waters have caused the base of ice near the ocean floor around the south pole to shrink by 1,463 square kilometers—an area the size of Greater London—between 2010 and 2016, according to the new study published in Nature Geoscience. Climate change is affecting the Antarctic more than previously believed and is likely to prompt global projections of sea-level rise to be revised upward. Until recently, the Antarctic was seen as relatively stable.	0
And trees absorb light and heat in the summer and keep cold winds out in the winter, he added. With already warmer temperatures, this leads to the melting of permafrost and the release of greenhouse gases like methane. In fact, 1,400 gigatons of carbon — the amount equivalent to 43 times as much carbon as fossil fuels and industry produced last year, according to the International Energy Agency — is at risk of escaping into the atmosphere if permafrost melts, he added.	0
The earth is racing toward “global extinction” similar to the era of the dinosaurs, as half the world’s species are allegedly failing to cope with global warming. Wiens said that while we may not quite be at the level of “global extinction of entire species that have already happened,” we are unfortunately “on track for that to happen.” “If we don’t do anything,” Wiens warned, “it seems like that’s going to happen in the next 50 to 100 years.” Wiens said that the Trump election bodes badly for the future of the planet, exacerbated by his appointment of climate change skeptic Scott Pruitt as head of the EPA and his determination to pull out of the Paris Climate Change Accord (COP21).	0
– examines the discrepancies between raw and adjusted sea level data in Aden, Karachi and Mumbai. Stable sea levels can be rendered to look like they are nonetheless rising at an accelerated pace. The data-adjusters take misaligned and incomplete sea level data from tide gauges that show no sea level rise (or even a falling trend).	2
There has been no global warming for nearly 19 years. A couple of months ago, you’ll recall, they merely claimed that the satellite data were ‘lying’.	2
Alarmist scientists have been caught red-handed tampering with raw data in order to exaggerate sea level rise. Local sea level trends in the last 140 years had been very gently rising, neutral or negative (ie sea levels had fallen). But after the evidence had been adjusted by tidal records gatekeepers at the global databank Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) it suddenly showed a sharp and dramatic rise.	1
Monson: I think it suffices to say that the motivation to effectively price carbon emissions will be impossible without a sufficient stimulus. People are linking recent weather phenomena with the concept of global warming. Hurricane Katrina, the European heat wave, flooding in Pakistan, or even the sweltering days of last summer, all of these recent events have opened peoples’ eyes to the potential dangers of global warming, even if it is difficult to definitively draw a direct connection between the two.	1
Officials in Madrid have gone further, with plans to make its city center car-free by 2020. The world has to begin a long-term shift from fossil fuels to more sustainable forms of energy. Recognizing “clean diesel” for the oxymoron it is would be a good place to start.	0

Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment, says he is confident that US renewable energy investment will continue because industry decisions will “not be decided by politics, but by the market.” The new report sends a strong message to consumers and investors that solar energy is here to stay, he says. Solar can take on fossil fuels. “Solar can compete.”	1
'” The United Nations recently released a report that ignored data their scientists collected that found there has been pause in warming over the last 15 years. Balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate. For instance, even the if there is a “human influence” on potential global warming, the NAS study found that it is not due t greenhouse gases.	0
Slapping a label on such storms is unnecessary. It’s appropriate to call such storms “global warming type” events. Here’s Trenberth’s reply, which lies somewhat in a middle ground: I agree that not all should be so labeled.	0
To the contrary, there is good evidence that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is environmentally helpful.” As Joanne Nova, Australian author, points out: “Everything on your dinner table–the meat, cheese, salad, bread, and soft drink–requires carbon dioxide to be there. Carbon dioxide is a pollutant. Science, Common Sense, and the 21st Century’s Hottest Topic.	1
Some of the key findings of the Yale report include: • Six in ten Americans (59%) think global warming is affecting weather in the United States, and half think weather is being affected “a lot” (25%) or “some” (27%). Global warming is a relatively distant threat. They are less likely to think it will harm people in the U.S. (58%), their own grandchildren (56%) or children (50%), people in their community (48%), their family (47%), themselves (43%), or members of their extended family living outside the U.S. (41%).	2
"According to a new study published yesterday (Aug. 1) in the journal Nature, there&apos;s about twice as much carbon dioxide (CO2) stored in Earth&apos;s soil as there is floating around the atmosphere, and for the last few decades, that underground greenhouse gas has been leaking out at a significantly increased rate. The rate of CO2 released from Earth&apos;s soil has increased globally by about 1.2 percent in just 25 years. ""We&apos;re talking about a huge quantity of carbon,"" study co-author Vanessa Bailey, a soil scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington state, said in a statement."	0
AFP reports today, “Global warming rate less than feared: study”: High levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere may have less of an impact on the rate of global warming than feared, a study said Thursday. Global warming is real. But the more severe estimates, such as those put forth by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, are unlikely, the researchers found in their study published in the journal Science….	0
Huge spending cuts at the federal or state level, never mind both, are putting the state’s populace at greater risk. Fossil fuel extraction may be less an economic boon than a massive liability. Louisiana, with its oil refineries and offshore rigs, has the third-worst poverty rate in the nation—and that is sadly typical of fossil-fuel-heavy states.	0
And some of the country’s largest pension funds, including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and New York State’s retirement fund, have begun tilting away from fossil fuels. Over the long term, fossil fuels are a losing bet. Some experts told me that the historic accord on limiting greenhouse-gas emissions reached in Paris last year was a turning point in how investors think about climate change.	1
If California is able to achieve their 2020 target of 427 million tons of CO2 equivalent, it will be less than a 0.4% change in world emissions. Man-made carbon dioxide emissions do not drive global temperatures. No wonder Prop 23 opponents have abandoned arguments about stopping climate change.	2
In addition to education and action, the travel industry is devising ways to become resilient to changing climates and along the way, is even discovering new tourism opportunities. Global warming had made traveling to Botswana in October, normally a pleasant time to visit temperature-wise, more challenging because of uncomfortably hot weather. Five years ago, the temperatures hovered in the high 80s to low 90s whereas last year, they exceeded 95 degrees.	0
For those people, it’s imperative that they’re made aware of the scientific realities of what’s happening to our climate. Ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate. With all the distracting attacks on climate scientists, these scientific realities are getting drowned out in all the noise.	0
The reality is that we have just gone through arguably the strongest El Nino for a century or more, and yet atmospheric temperatures have barely peaked above 1998. Global temperatures drop further still. One more thing.	1
Liberal environmentalist non-profits are urging people to eat organic, consume less meat, and consider the carbon footprint of their Thanksgiving feast. The Center for Food Safety cites University of Manchester researchers’ claim that a turkey and all-the-trimmings meal for eight people produces 44 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions.	1
“The IPCC graph you refer to is just a draft version which still has a number of problems that will be ironed out,” Potsdam University physics professor Stefan Rahmstorf told FoxNews.com. The chart does not mean that global warming is a hoax. “The IPCC&apos;s claim is that they are 90 percent sure that humans have &apos;contributed to&apos; the observed warming.	1
Or in other words: economic growth and improved technology are clear drivers of increased energy demand, but let’s not confound these with energy efficiency improvements and rebound. Global energy demand is going to increase over time. (And yes, what causes economic growth is one of the most important — and most vexing — questions in economics.)	1
The dangers of carbon dioxide, he believes, have been much overrated. The non-climatic effects of carbon dioxide as a sustainer of wildlife and crop plants are enormously beneficial, that the possibly harmful climatic effects of carbon dioxide have been greatly exaggerated, and that the benefits clearly outweigh the possible damage. I consider myself an unprejudiced person and to me these facts are obvious.	2
We have accepted our guilt on faith – faith in science. Burning fossil fuels emits CO2, a greenhouse gas, making the world heat up like a greenhouse sitting in the sun. Since we the voters have accepted our guilt, our democratically elected governments have too – and when governments see guilt, they see crime.	0
BP and Royal Dutch Shell had already left the conservative policy group. The fossil fuel industry spent nearly 18 percent of all climate lobbying dollars during the period examined. In a statement, spokesman Reid Porter said the industry “also invests more in the development and deployment of greenhouse gas reducing technologies.” The Sierra Club, which made up part of the 2.3 percent sliver of climate lobbying dollars that came from environmental groups, blamed “the unlimited money fossil fuel polluters have poured into our political system” for making “the debate on the climate crisis in the United States … radically different than in every other country on earth.” To try to counter that disparity in lobbying dollars, legislative director Melinda Pierce said the nonprofit mobilizes “more than three million members and supporters.” Brulle suggested that climate advocates could exploit differences between industry sectors that have historically opposed climate legislation as a way to disrupt their lobbying power.	1

July 4, 10:31 a.m. | Updated | Mick has added more reflections on his blog, including this thought: The specific proposal I made in this particular essay is that the current oil-and-gas boom in the US and Canada will make the West stronger in the short term, and that this is a good thing, even though it will add climate emissions. We need to more or less immediately stop using or drastically curtail fossil fuels. I also make some admittedly vague proposals for using the proceeds of the oil boom in Keynesian fashion to buy useful renewable energy and energy efficiency capital, to help maintain that geopolitical strength in the long term.	0
In a new study, the most comprehensive to date of the continent&apos;s icy status, an international group of 84 researchers analyzed data from multiple satellite surveys, from 1992 to 2017. Antarctica is currently losing ice about three times faster than it did until 2012, climbing to a rate of more than 241 billion tons (219 billion metric tons) per year. Total ice loss during the 25-year period contributed to sea level rise of about 0.3 inches (around 8 millimeters), approximately 40 percent of which — about 0.1 inches (3 mm) — happened in the past five years.	1
2. We are all familiar with the general outlines of globalization. Yet curiously, this lenient Cold War-era trade strategy persisted even after the end of the Cold War.	1
Global warming is a myth. The poll also found that those who believed in global warming remained roughly the same, but those who were undecided dropped six percentage points, leading to the conclusion that many of those who were once vacillating now disbelieve global warming.	2
He’s had a similar approach to climate change. No use in denying global warming exists. Newt Gingrich, Former Speaker of the House Gingrich used to think Congress should address climate change—as seen in the bizarre commercial with Nancy Pelosi embedded below.	0
"""Our record thus provides the first direct indication of a much smaller LIG WAIS, providing paleo-context for the susceptibility of the WAIS to collapse."" As the Antarctic ice sheet continues to melt away, we expect multi-meter sea level rise from Antarctica in the coming centuries. Another recent study also shed light on the startling rise in sea-levels and the effects climate change is having on the planet."	0
"If society actually did that, we&apos;d have a 64 percent chance of limiting the average global temperature rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels, said study lead researcher Christopher Smith, a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science at the University of Leeds, in England. We could ramp down all of the fossil-fuel-emitting infrastructure that we have, all of the way until it reaches the end of its life. ""And then we&apos;d replace it with something [that emits] zero carbon."""	1
(The activities and journalists’ travel costs, including mine, were underwritten by the Earth Journalism Network of Internews, a nonprofit group seeking to foster unfettered, credible and innovative media around the world. There is no “global warming” story. This opaque term encompasses a dizzying range of stories and issues, from the basic science pointing to a rising human influence on Earth’s climate system to the tougher question of how much warming is too much, to the global and regional debates about the mix of policies that offers the smoothest human path on a crowding planet.	2
Unfortunately for public knowledge, such findings don’t appear in the news. The Arctic sea ice cover is rapidly retreating while the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily expanding. State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers.	1
"CLIMATE CHANGE COULD CAUSE &apos;SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE&apos; IN EXTREME STORMS, NASA SAYS Collectively, the past five years are ""the warmest years in the modern record,"" NASA added. Since the 1880s, the global temperature has risen approximately 2 degrees Fahrenheit. That&apos;s largely due to ""increased emissions into the atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases caused by human activities,"" Schmidt said."	1
Jim Lakely, a spokesman for the Heartland Institute, said he hoped United Nations climate delegates would also hear his group’s message. Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is not the driver of global warming. “So there is no moral case for restricting the use of fossil fuels, especially because that is vital to raising the quality and length of life of the world’s poorest people.” Diplomats from other countries said they were glad to see governors, mayors and other Americans still committed to the Paris agreement making their presence felt.	2
Even forecasts of natural global cooling at a rate of 1 ºC per century were much more accurate over long periods than the IPCC’s projections of dangerous man-made global warming. Global temperatures had reached a dangerous “tipping point,” with extreme warming imminent and unavoidable. Professor Scott Armstrong challenged Mr. Gore to a ten-year bet based on the Green-Armstrong-Soon (2009)) scientific no-change forecast of global mean temperatures.	0
by 10 percent, which in turn represents more than 30 percent of all human emissions since 1850), the global air temperature, more accurately measured by satellite sensors, shows no increase and certainly no sign of accelerating. Carbon dioxide emissions provide the environmentally vital services of greening the planet and assuring our food supply. What causes both the widespread alarmism and the public ignorance of the beneficial effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide?	2
(The summary is appended below.) In the long run, the costs from raising the price of fossil-fueled electricity and other sources of energy could be modest. Public support for accepting the costs attending an accelerated shift away from the fuels of convenience, particularly coal, remains weak, at best.	1
He filed another lawsuit against the EPA regional haze rule, which requires state plans to clear the air around national parks. Carbon pollution harms human health and is therefore subject to the Clean Air Act. In a CNN interview just hours before Trump’s speech Tuesday, Pruitt revealed just how desperate Republicans sometimes are to avoid talking to the public about how their plans would impact air and water.	1
“No, ‘big polluters’ won’t bear these costs,” the board writes. We should work for a national carbon tax instead. K, I’ll ask President Trump what he thinks and let ya know!	1
Two years after President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that their countries would work together to combat climate change, Republicans and conservatives in the United States continue to cite China’s rising carbon emissions as a reason not to bother cutting our own. Limiting our carbon pollution is pointless because of China’s supposedly growing coal dependency. “Every time we shut down a coal plant in the US, China builds 10,” Moore told E&E News.	2
As of September, opponents had raised more than $16 million, outpacing the initiative’s sponsors. Fossil fuel companies should pay a carbon tax. And Initiative 1631’s backers think public health argu­ments will resonate with voters.	1
[See the update below including a sea-ice scientist’s take on such wagers.] Profound changes are well under way that virtually guarantee the Arctic described in history books. There will be problems and opportunities, as I and other Times reporters chronicled in detail in our 2005 series “The Big Melt” and as I wrote in my book, “The North Pole Was Here.” But is this a situation that is appropriately described as a “death spiral”?	1
Dr. Duane Thresher, who has a PhD in climate science from Columbia and NASA GISS, told Breitbart News that attributing specific climatic events to global warming is simply dishonest. It is a fundamental fact, although increasingly ignored, that no single climate event or location can be attributed to global warming. “There is simply no valid way to prove a connection and correlation is not causation.” According to Thresher, relying on simple correlation leads to absurd conclusions like the following: “As global warming has supposedly been occurring, the average human lifespan has significantly increased.	2
“Just last week, the UN’s environment programme said the voluntary national contributions agreed in Paris would have to triple if the world was to cap global warming below 2C,” AFP reported. While the data are clear, a global political consensus over how to tackle climate change remains elusive. But President Donald Trump decided in June to withdraw the United States from the agreement and reiterated his opposition to it because of the fiscal and other harm it would cause the United States at the recent G20 summit in Argentina.	1
In this news story, reporter Walter Sullivan noted many scientists believed global cooling was “inevitable,” but he also said there were numerous researchers predicting massive, catastrophic global warming within the next century. A new ice age is on the way. And there are those who say that such pollution may actually head off an ice age.	1
Energy researcher Vaclav Smil suggests in The American that these developments should mean the end of “peak oil” anxieties: Obviously, there will come a time when global oil extraction will reach its peak, but even that point may be of little practical interest as it could be followed by a prolonged, gentle decline or by an extended output plateau at a somewhat lower level than peak production. We’ve increased spending on oil production by tremendous amounts only to see global oil production edge up a bit. Older, cheaper oil fields are declining, and their oil is being replaced by crude from far more expensive sources.	1
"""The loss in consumption is relatively modest,"" Pachauri said. The shift would entail a near-quadrupling of low-carbon energy — which in the panel&apos;s projections included renewable sources as well as nuclear power and fossil fuel-fired plants equipped with technologies to capture some of the emissions. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called it a global economic opportunity."	1
As Princeton University’s Michael Oppenheimer told the Associated Press, climate-change-triggered sea level rise caused flooding to reach 50,000 more people than it would have otherwise. By the year 2100, floods like the ones caused by Sandy could become 1-in-20-year events. And yet Congress hasn’t considered any serious climate change legislation since the storm.	0
Such statements have often been accompanied in the media by cartoons of Uncle Sam as a junkie, desperately injecting his next petroleum “fix.” But few analysts have carried the analogy further, exploring the ways our growing dependence on oil has generated increasingly erratic and self-destructive behavior. Addiction to fossil fuels has reached a point at which we should expect the judgment of senior leaders to become impaired, as seems to be happening. The most persuasive evidence that fossil fuel addiction has reached a critical stage may be found in official US data on carbon dioxide emissions.	0
More importantly, let’s drill down into that all important phrase “on record.” Global temperatures in 2009 are the highest on record only if: 1) the “record” starts in the mid nineteenth century, when semi-reliable temperature records first come into play, or 2) the “record” goes back millennia but includes only that portion of the secondary indicators (aka: proxy data), like tree rings and ice cores, that organizations like the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (CRU) and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) would like us to consider. 150 years or so of data is far too little to be of any significance when it comes to a system as dynamic and complex as global climate. One can not discern a trend based on a snapshot.	2
But this risk reduction brings risks of its own. Crop insurance has played a role in encouraging farmers to expand row crops onto marginal land like wetlands or prairie, which exacerbates vulnerability to erosion, floods, and drought. And yet the crop insurance program provides no formal incentive for water conservation or soil preservation, key elements in climate adaptation.	1
“Our paper’s showing that pH is already well beyond the historical threshold,” coauthor Abby Frazier told reporters Tuesday. There is no major push to curb carbon emissions in the coming years. The study also predicted a second set of temperatures for an alternate future, in which there’s what lead researcher Camilo Mora calls a “strong and concerted” effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.	1
The new identified photochemical reaction is therefore important to improve the climate models. The oceans not only take up heat and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A key role is played by the so-called surface microlayer (SML), especially at low wind speed.	1
They quickly backed down and withdrew their letter when they saw this action backfire … forgetting that the Internet keeps things from falling in the “memory hole.” Photo credit: Shutterstock So the said letter is the rehashing of the catastrophic, man-made climate hysteria upon which we must promptly act, despite an abysmal track record of climate predictions. The global warming narrative is a religion. Real science is always open for new ideas as long as they respect the scientific method – if facts support a hypothesis and then bring a conclusion.	2
And all this will come with a hefty cost, the report says. Flooding alone may cost $325 billion by the year 2100 in one of the worst-case scenarios, with $130 billion of that in Florida. Already the droughts and heat waves of 2011 and 2012 added about $10 billion to farm costs, the report says.	1
In Harvey, 25.6 inches fell over that same area. Climate change significantly increased the amount of rain that flooded Houston. While the advance attribution for Florence was unusual, since it was looking at predicted forecasts rather than the actual event, it seems to fit in that same context.	0

The difference being that ours is human caused, isn’t going to take 80,000 years, has so far lasted just a few centuries, and is now gaining speed in a non-linear fashion. On top of the vast quantities of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels that continue to enter the atmosphere in record amounts yearly. Some scientists fear that the situation is already so serious and so many self-reinforcing feedback loops are already in play that we are in the process of causing our own extinction.	1
Paradoxically, heat-trapping greenhouse gases — considered the major cause of global warming — are also helping to rebuild the ozone layer, Newman said. Rising levels of carbon dioxide and other gases cool the upper stratosphere, and the cooler air increases the amount of ozone. And in another worrisome trend, the chemicals that replaced CFCs contribute to global warming and are on the rise, said MIT atmospheric scientist Susan Solomon.	1
"(Kena Betancur/Getty Images) Nye added that he ""encourages"" everyone to look at the facts. The polar ice caps would melt completely by the mid-2010's causing the sea levels to rise by meters, which would then put low-lying coastal areas across the world under water. None of these things ever happened."	0
And truly catastrophic storms will do damage unimaginable today. If you have, say, five feet of sea level rise, it’s going to be much more devastating. And that spells trouble: 50 percent of the nation’s shorelines, 11,200 miles in all, are highly vulnerable to sea level rise, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.	0
The second position questions the allegedly “unprecedented” nature of modern climate phenomena such as warming, sea levels, glacier and sea ice retreat, and hurricane and drought intensities. These events fall within the range of natural variability, while 38 found an absence of significant anthropogenic causality in rising sea levels. The third position casts doubt upon the efficacy and reliability of computer climate models for projecting future climate states, suggesting that such predictions are “little more than speculation” given the enormous uncertainty and margins of error in a non-linear climate system with nearly infinite variables.	1
And I’m not the only one. A lot of Americans are growing far more concerned about climate change, precisely because they’re drawing the links between freaky weather, a climate kicked off-kilter by a fossil-fuel guzzling civilization, and their own lives. After a year with a record number of multi-billion dollar weather disasters, seven in ten Americans now believe that “global warming is affecting the weather.” No less striking, 35 percent of the respondents reported that extreme weather had affected them personally in 2011.	0
There is a clear connection between rising global temperatures and type-2 diabetes. According to the report, titled “Diabetes incidence and glucose intolerance prevalence increase with higher outdoor temperature,” for every 1 degree Celsius increase in temperature, there is an age-adjusted diabetes incidence increase of 0.314 per 1,000 people.	1
Warming temperatures in Pacific Ocean waters off the coast of North America over the past century closely follow natural changes in the wind, not the increases in greenhouse gases related to global warming.

“It became clear to me very quickly that these weren’t just heavy ice conditions, these were unprecedented ice conditions,” Dr. David Barber, the lead scientist on the study, told VICE. Global warming is a major problem and deserving of our urgent attention. He told Vice: “It was clear it was from the Arctic, I just needed to be among the ice to see it,” said Dr. Barber.	0
A 2010 report by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences warns, “There is also a possibility that certain aeroallergens may become more allergenic as temperatures and CO2 concentrations increase.” (Besides exacerbating the pollen count, climate change is linked in some regions to a rise in ozone, fine particles, and dust—all of which can cause or worsen respiratory diseases, the report found.) The weeds that produce many allergens have adapted the best to an atmosphere that is chock-full of carbon dioxide. Pollen from ragweed, for instance, which peaks in the summer and is one of the most common triggers for allergies, has exploded as the climate has warmed.	1
And infinitely worse for the people who are starving. Europe’s financial losses related to flooding, which now total about 4.9 billion euros a year, could increase almost 380% to 23.5 billion euros by 2050. Studies about the future impact of climate change are one thing that’s not in short supply.	1
“I was surprised at the strength of that, and the extent to which voters had begun to recognize the severe weather, and experience it,” Maxfield says. Climate scientists themselves are increasingly outspoken about explaining that global warming is shifting the odds in favor of more heat waves, severe storms, and other weather extremes. Another set of messages Maxfield tested involve oil companies, which people perceive as having too much power.	1
If a reasonable concern over the fate of the planet were stronger than our reliance on fossil fuels, we would expect to see, if not a reduction in carbon emissions, then a decline at least in the rate of increase of emissions over time. Global emissions will continue to rise at a torrid pace over the next quarter century, reaching 45.5 billion metric tons in 2040—more than double the amount recorded in 1998 and enough, in the view of most scientists, to turn our planet into a living hell. Though seldom recognized as such, this is the definition of addiction-induced self-destruction, writ large.	0
Yet despite these threats, Perry has done worse than nothing to tackle the climate problem. I’ve heard Al Gore talk about global warming so much that I’m starting to think that his mouth is the leading source of all that supposedly deadly carbon dioxide. But Texas environmentalists say that native sons such as T. Boone Pickens and the state’s own burgeoning wind power industry have given Perry some room to occupy the middle ground on climate issues.	2
"""The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal,"" King noted. Today the world's leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear — that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy. ""Unfortunately, the Trump administration has become a rogue outlier in its shortsighted attempt to prop up the dirty fossil fuel industries of the past,"" Gore added."	0
Examining more than 1,000 years of stories from across Europe, the author concluded climate change and natural variability were nothing to be too excited or too worried about. Glaciers and sea ice may have been melting, but eventually Earth would move into an intense cooling pattern again. It was only a matter of time.	2
"If we're searching for ""global warming"" culprits, we might want to look at that 27,000,000 degree ball of gas in the sky. If human CO2 emissions are a primary driver of global temperatures, it wouldn't make sense for temperatures to drop or stay stagnate while humanity only continues to increase its CO2 output. But that's exactly what's happened."	2
Peter Lilley, a Conservative member of the Commons Energy and Climate Change committee, is quoted in the Telegraph as saying: “The survey exposes the hypocrisy of many who claim to be ‘green’: the greater the concern people express about global warming the less they do to reduce their energy usage.” Last month, it was revealed that Greenpeace’s international director, Pascal Husting, commuted between his home in Luxembourg and work in Amsterdam twice a month by plane. The carbon footprint generated would be equivalent to leaving a low-energy light bulb switched on for 220 years, or the average household energy consumption for two years.	1
If you want to appreciate just how hysterically over-the-top the report’s authors are, here’s a taste of one of them, speaking to the BBC. The threat to human health from climate change is so great that it could undermine the last 50 years of gains in developments in global health. Putting that bluntly, you’re suggesting that more people will die younger.	0
"A warning has been issued by scientists about ""devastating tsunamis"" caused by climate change. Rising sea levels – caused by global warming – significantly increase the threat of giant killer waves. Tsunamis are one of the deadliest natural disasters – and experts say they could get even worse."	0
This is when solar can really be called “cheap”—grid parity comes when solar is less expensive than fossil fuels, even without subsidies. Fossil fuels receive several types of subsidies. Ambrose Evans-Pritchard at the Telegraph describes the steady march towards this tipping point: The US Energy Department expects the cost of solar power to fall by 75pc between 2010 and 2020.	1

Gore was recently nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in drawing attention to climate change, while the film 'An Inconvenient Truth' earlier this year won an Oscar. Sea levels could rise six meters (20 feet) with the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Now, we know that the South Pole is gaining more ice than it’s losing.	1
“The reserves are going to be able to turn into money, because they’re assuming there isn’t going to be a policy change,” said Natural Resources Defense Council Director of Climate Programs David Hawkins. No matter what happens with climate change, the economics of fossil fuel production are likely to stay favorable for the foreseeable future. The price of carbon would need to rise past $200 per metric ton by 2050 to make burning it so expensive that greenhouse gas concentrations would level off at 450 parts per million, according to the report.	1
Whatever is happening to Earth’s climate does not seem to be our fault.” However, he does acknowledge that climate change is happening. The sea level has been rising since the end of the last Ice Age, starting about 14,000 years ago as the continental and mountain glaciers have melted and sea water has expanded with the overall warming. The average rate has been about a foot or two a century”.	1
And the president invested in carbon capture and sequestration technology as part of the Recovery Act. I’m from a coal state, so I believe that if there’s going to be a future for coal it has to be one that deals with carbon pollution, with climate change. So in my opinion the problem for coal right now is entirely economic.	0
"""There’s this myth that’s developed around carbon dioxide that it’s a pollutant, but you and I both exhale carbon dioxide with every breath. Each of us emits about two pounds of carbon dioxide a day. Happer, who has advised President Donald Trump on climate issues, said."	1
Also, various studies have followed the fluctuating average temperature of the earth, and a study in August 2017 reported that the average climate was actually cooler then than it was when Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work in pushing climate change awareness. The National Oceanic and Atmosphere Association fudged numbers to support the agenda of global warming. You can read the full report here.	2
“Residents of roughly 500 cities across the US will be faced with the same choices by the end of the century: whether to mitigate or to abandon their homes,” CNN reported on a study released on Wednesday by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). Scientists have been trying to get people to wake up to the dangers that lie ahead in rising seas due to climate change. “Between 165 and 180 chronically inundated communities in just the next 15 to 20 years; between 270 and 360 in roughly 40 years, depending on the pace of sea level rise; and 490 by end of century with a moderate sea level rise scenario,” Erika Spanger-Siegfried, co-author and senior climate analyst for UCS, said.	0
As we all now know, thanks mainly to alternative conservative media, the stranded Australian researchers are Global Warming believers who were there to document ice melt. In a Monday story about the logistics of the rescue, the Times completely ignores the Global Warming angle. The passengers were scientists, tourists and journalists on a research trip, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition.	1
Instead of studying the issue for themselves, people rely on the media and the scientists the media has promoted to provide them with scientific conclusions. In other words, to the extent the public believes in the theory humans are responsible for global warming. Based on climate-alarmist scientists’ track record, the answer is clearly “no.” Over the past three decades, many climate scientists have repeatedly made a number of significant and alarming predictions about global warming, and the vast majority of the time, they’ve been wrong—really, really wrong.	1
By extrapolating from that, other scientists have suggested there could be as little as 30 years of burning fossil fuels before the threshold is reached. Many of the world’s remaining fossil fuel resources must be left unexploited if the climate is not to be put in danger, and prominent scientific and political leaders are increasingly calling for this to be recognized. Gore and Blood’s recommendations could take a decade to complete, the partners admit, but they insist that the first steps at least should be undertaken urgently.	0
“But, there’s a hitch. A far more likely contender for the cause of the glacier melt is the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation. Iceland is located in the north Atlantic, which has been experiencing a warm phase since about 1980.	2
"Such gases, mainly CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, rose on average by 2.2 percent a year in 2000-2010, driven by the use of coal in the power sector, officials said as they launched the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change&apos;s report on measures to fight global warming. Without additional measures to contain emissions, global temperatures will rise about 5 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 compared to current levels. ""The longer we delay the higher would be the cost,"" IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri told The Associated Press after the panel&apos;s weeklong session in Berlin."	0
Just ask ski-area business owners from Vermont to California, who are still slogging through a major bummer of a winter this season. Global warming, unsurprisingly, is bad news for snowpack. To fight back, in 2007 Jones created Protect Our Winters, a nonprofit alliance of snow athletes that raises money and lobbies politicians to pass legislation limiting greenhouse gas emissions and supporting clean energy.	0
Bernt Balchen, polar explorer and flier [now serving with General Dynamics], is circulating a paper among polar specialists proposing that the Arctic pack ice is thinning and that the ocean at the North Pole may become an open sea within a decade or two. An ice-free Arctic Ocean would not freeze again. These dire predictions, and many more just like them, never occurred, of course, but they all have one thing in common: Environmentalists have consistently used scientific projections to justify radical, often socialistic policy changes, including carbon taxes and exchanges, incentives to limit population growth and other extreme measures that take power away from individuals and give it to an ever-growing centralized government.	1
The world is on the verge of collapse because of humans’ use of fossil fuels. For example, the San Jose Mercury News (Calif.) reported on June 30, 1989: “A senior environmental official at the United Nations, Noel Brown, says entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000.	0
Though it may also be caused by the naturally occurring La Niña weather pattern, human-induced global warming “is almost certainly making this extreme event worse,” Texas A&M climate scientist Andrew Dessler told ThinkProgress Green. Global warming could spell disaster for the state’s water supply. Population growth alone would make coping with a multi-year drought like the one Texas experienced in the 1950s “extremely difficult,” he writes.	0
That’s the word from a new study conducted in Iceland and accepted for publication in Geophysical Research Letters. Glacier melt in Iceland will cause more volcanoes everywhere. Rather, the authors of the report merely observe that, as warming occurs Iceland’s glaciers are melting at an increased rate, causing the ground beneath them to rise at an accelerated rate (due to the weight of the glaciers being removed).	0
According to its website: “COP24 is the informal name for the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).” “The UNFCCC is a ‘Rio Convention,’ one of three adopted at the ‘Rio Earth Summit’ in 1992. Right now we’re facing a man-made disaster on a global scale. Follow Penny Starr on Twitter	0
We’re rebuilding in places we shouldn’t. The world will experience a rise in sea level of several feet. This means that cities and towns on the shoreline are guaranteed an increase in flooding vulnerability.	1
In 2008, Fingar, now a fellow at Stanford University, took the lead in drafting the first national intelligence assessment on the security challenges presented by climate change. Global warming will further destabilize already-volatile parts of the world and should be considered in national security planning. But congressional Republicans dismissed the report as “a waste of resources.” In fact, monitoring environmental factors isn’t much of a departure for intelligence analysts—who have long kept tabs on variables like changing weather patterns, which can affect food production, as a predictor of regional instability.	0
“That gives us even more reason to care about climate change,” says Hayhoe, “because it is affecting people, and is disproportionately affecting the poor, and the vulnerable, and those who cannot care for themselves.” The fact remains, though, that most evangelical Christians in the United States do not think as Hayhoe does. While 64 percent of Americans think global warming is real and caused by human beings, only 44 percent of evangelicals do. Evangelicals in general, explains Hayhoe, tend to be more politically conservative, and can be quite distrusting of scientists (believing, incorrectly, that they’re all a bunch of atheists).	1
Different countries have different densities, so to speak, of global warming denial. In particular, English-language speaking nations like the US and the UK tend to be relative denialist hotbeds, and their media include a considerable amount of global warming skepticism.	1
Fifty-four percent of Americans are now saying that the effects of global warming have already begun. News about global warming is generally exaggerated. For most climate experts, however, the battle is long over—at least when it comes to the science.	2
“If a model is making bad predictions, which these climate models are, the theory that underlies them must be wrong. Atmospheric reaction to carbon dioxide, known as climate sensitivity, is probably too high for these models. “If you take this climate sensitivity model and tone it down, you get a much closer match to reality.” He contends that the computer models are overcompensating for the addition of CO2’s to the atmosphere.	1
The research is among the first to attempt to quantify, over 12 Corn Belt states, how much carbon is lost to the atmosphere when the stalks, leaves and cobs that make up residue are removed and used to make biofuel, instead of left to naturally replenish the soil with carbon. Regardless of how much corn residue is taken off the field, the process contributes to global warming. “I knew this research would be contentious,” said Adam Liska, the lead author and an assistant professor of biological systems engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.	1
Just have a read of this bit: The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has said that the Government’s focus is “to create policy to ensure energy is affordable and secure and that in the past the balance had swung too far in favour of climate change policies”. This market-led, consumer-based approach would lead to carbon reduction. With historically low oil prices and significant reserves of coal globally, there is potential for the cheapest fuel for power generation to be the one that is most polluting.	1
You may have seen a version of the graph, known as the “hockey stick,” in the film An Inconvenient Truth—the rise in carbon dioxide levels* is so steep, Al Gore uses a mechanical ladder to reach the most recent readings. The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate. There, he and his colleagues explained the complex methodology, and the uncertainties, involved in their study; but let’s face it, phrases like “multiproxy data network” and “extensive cross-validation experiments” are lost on most of us.	0
“It’s evidence that climate doesn’t respond gradually to gradual forcing. It would be wonderful in global warming if everything just kept pace with the gradual rise in CO2. That’s because there are positive feedback mechanisms that start to kick in and speed things up.	1
In contrast, sudden termination increases both ocean and land temperature velocities to unprecedented speeds,” they said. The effects would be two to four times worse than with global warming alone. This story originally appeared in news.com.au.	1
Here they quickly melted, adding thousands of tonnes of water to the world’s oceans. If ice shelves in Antarctica undergo similar processes, it could spell disaster for Earth. Combined with melting in Greenland, we could see sea levels rise by almost two meters this century.	0
“This is probably the most difficult task we have ever given ourselves, which is to intentionally transform the economic development model, for the first time in human history,” Figueres said. This moment requires us to rethink democracy as a global mechanism for enacting policy for and by the planet. The final word comes from the wealthiest man in the world who, having enjoyed capitalism for himself is less enthused about it for the rest of us.	1
“The reserves are going to be able to turn into money, because they’re assuming there isn’t going to be a policy change,” said Natural Resources Defense Council Director of Climate Programs David Hawkins. No matter how bad it gets, the world’s addiction to fossil fuels will be so overwhelming that the governments of the world will just suck it up and let people suffer. The price of carbon would need to rise past $200 per metric ton by 2050 to make burning it so expensive that greenhouse gas concentrations would level off at 450 parts per million, according to the report.	0
Last week, Policy Horizons Canada, a Canadian government agency, declared that climate change had forced Santa Claus to move his workshop from the North Pole to the South Pole. Thanks to rising global temperatures, rapidly melting Arctic ice and growing human operations in the North, Santa Claus has signed an agreement with the International community to relocate his village next year to operate in an exclusive zone in the South Pole. The post was one of many holiday-themed articles the agency published ahead of the holiday season.	1
The result, say scientists, is a significant dimming of the brightness of the world’s snow and icefields, leading to a longer melt season, which in turn creates feedback where more solar heat is absorbed and the melting accelerates. The Arctic ice cap, which is thought to have lost an average of 12.9 billion tonnes of ice a year between 1992 and 2010 due to general warming, may be losing an extra 27 billion tonnes a year just because of dust, potentially adding several centimeters of sea-level rise by 2100. Satellite measurements, say the authors, show that in the last 10 years the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet has considerably darkened during the melt season, which in some areas is now between 6 and 11 days longer per decade than it was 40 years ago.	0
When Kopp and colleagues charted the sea level rise over the centuries — they went back 3,000 years, but aren&apos;t confident in the most distant 200 years — they saw Earth&apos;s sea level was on a downward trend until the industrial age. Sea level rise in the 20th century is mostly man-made. A separate, not-yet-published study by Kopp and others found since 1950, about two-thirds of the U.S. nuisance coastal floods in 27 locales have the fingerprints of man-made warming.	1
Advocates of harnessing market forces say sustaining economic growth is crucial to maintain political support for climate action. A price on carbon can be effective at reducing emissions if it’s tried on a sustained, economy-wide basis. “I don’t think we need to fundamentally rewrite the rules” of the economy to aim for net zero emissions, says Joseph Majkut, a policy expert at the free-market oriented Niskanen Center in Washington, D.C. “I’m not saying that it’s a small transition,” he says, but Americans can check on a carbon tax every five years to see its results and potentially adjust it if needed.	1
If oceans were to rise by just 1.8 meters, large swathes of coastal cities would find themselves underwater, turning streets into canals and completely submerging some buildings. Sea levels made this jump 115,000 years ago because of a sudden ice collapse in Antarctica. The continent’s vulnerable West Antarctic ice sheet — which is already retreating again today — released a lot of sea level rise in a hurry.	1
This is the first attempt by the world’s biggest exporter to exploit the Arctic’s disappearing ice to reach its biggest market—the European Union. Global warming would affect the planet first in the Arctic. “Temperatures have risen dramatically.	0
Others argue that it might even be a good thing: See: Rep. Joe Read (R-Mont. Global warming is beneficial to the welfare and business. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) climate of Montana.” The Rapture-ready: Contend that the planet cannot be warming because it was not foretold in the Bible—and even if it were warming, good news!	2
The seas around the North Pole may be losing their summer ice cover, but there is still the ever-present danger of icebergs and drifting slabs of pack ice. Satellite photographs may suggest an area is completely clear of ice, but there is still a chance that a ship will encounter drifts of ice. “It is very unlikely that the Yong Sheng will go through these waters on its own.	1
That count includes pieces like Bryce’s April 2010 op-ed in the Washington Post, “Five Myths About Green Energy,” which includes lines like, “[I]n in the electric car’s century-long history, failure tailgates failure.” The piece describes Bryce as a senior fellow at Manhattan Institute, but doesn’t mention the funding. Increasing the use of wind will actually increase our emissions of carbon dioxide. Bryce also popped up in a Christian Science Monitor piece on lessons from the BP oil spill, arguing that nothing can compete with oil—again, with no indication that his organization has a dog in the fight.	1
On top of that they checked their figures by easy markers such as the rise of lead with the start of the industrial age and isotopes only seen in the atomic age. Earth&apos;s sea level was on a downward trend until the industrial age. Sea level rise in the 20th century is mostly man-made, the study authors said.	0
I challenge Thom Hartmann to name even one. This is about economic migration and about political instability, not about global warming. As for those five million climate refugees.	2
 FILE - This Feb. 22,2013 file photo shows Two heavily damaged homes on the beach in Mantoloking, N.J., from Superstorm Sandy. Man-made global warming may further lessen the likelihood of the freak atmospheric steering currents that last year shoved Superstorm Sandy due west into New Jersey. But don&apos;t celebrate a rare beneficial climate change prediction just yet.	2
Arctic sea ice has officially reached its minimum extent for the summer, shrinking to 5.1 million square kilometers. That’s significantly higher than last year’s record low of just over 3.4 million square kilometers, a fact that has led conservative news outlets and even members of Congress to suggest that worries about global warming and melting ice are overstated.	1
New data released last month by researchers at Yale and George Mason universities show that a lot of Americans are growing far more concerned about climate change, precisely because they’re drawing the links between freaky weather, a climate kicked off-kilter by a fossil-fuel guzzling civilization, and their own lives. Global warming is affecting the weather. As Yale’s Anthony Laiserowitz told the New York Times, “People are starting to connect the dots.” Which is what we must do.	0
"“Nature doesn’t give us a safe climate that we make dangerous,"" he said. It gives us a dangerous climate that we make safe, above all, by using energy from fossil fuels. “My conclusion is that, if we look at the big picture, not only are the economic benefits [of fossil fuels] overwhelmingly positive, but the environmental benefits are overwhelmingly positive,” he said."	2
“That could be done in a simple way by collecting a fee from the fossil fuel companies that would gradually rise over time—a carbon fee and dividend. I call it a carbon fee because you would give all of the money to the public, a dividend to each legal resident. “ have adopted almost precisely as I proposed it in 2008.	1
Prior to this happy event, I thought the chances of the Senate passing a cap and trade bill were slim, but that the possibility still existed. Global warming skeptics may have a point or two after all. Good riddance.	2
As suggested by the IEA, “Much is riding on Iraq’s success… Without this supply growth from Iraq, oil markets would be set for difficult times.” Continuing Reliance on Fossil Fuels For all the talk of the need to increase reliance on renewable sources of energy, fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas—will continue to provide most of the additional energy supplies needed to satisfy soaring world demand. The world is still failing to put the global energy system onto a more sustainable path. In the United States, for instance, the increased extraction of oil and gas from shale formations has largely silenced calls for government investment in renewable technology.	0
Unlike previous efforts, the temperature data from various sources was not homogenized by hand—a key criticism by climate skeptics. The average global land temperature has risen by about 1 degree Celsius since the mid-1950s. But the team did not look for possible fingerprints to explain this warming.	1
“Well, this is what we can do and it’s a win-win: to have a fee on carbon. So if you are raising livestock and producing a lot of carbon dioxide with your farm equipment and the exhaust from the animals, then you would pay a fee on that and it would be reflected in the price of meat, reflected in the price of fish, reflected in the price of peanuts. “This would be a free-market way to reckon the real cost of a meat diet to the world,” Nye continued.	1
That’s why scientists have long feared a day like this would come. Major glaciers that are part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet appear to have become irrevocably destabilized. The whole process may still play out on the scale of centuries, but due to the particular dynamics of this ice sheet, the collapse of these major glaciers now “appears unstoppable,” according to NASA (whose researchers are behind one of the two studies).	0
Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP This story originally appeared in the Guardian and is republished here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Last month was the hottest May globally. The record heat, combined with increasingly certain predictions of an El Niño, means experts are now speculating whether 2014 could become the hottest year on record.	1
“I expect they’re probably holding back on the full extent they’re looking at carbon risk as it can help them gain an edge over their rivals and lot of this information is proprietary,” says Caldecott. The CRVT is the first iteration of a carbon risk tool and presently only offers a somewhat generalized analysis. But he says the response from Bloomberg customers has been positive and the tool foreshadows a future when algorithms will routinely calculate the financial impact of other environmental risks, such as water shortages and extreme weather spawned by climate change.	1
It would be premature to suggest that the “450 Scenario” will be the immediate roadmap for humanity, since it’s clear enough that, for the moment, we are on a highway to hell that combines the IEA’s first two scenarios. A global temperature increase of even 2 degrees Celsius would be enough to produce catastrophic climate effects. But as the effects of climate change become more pronounced in our lives, count on one thing: the clamor for government action will grow more intense, and so eventually we’re likely to see some variation of the 450 Scenario take shape.	0
Based on what we have seen of his administration so far, the same is true of Obama’s newfound commitment to offshore drilling. Burning fossil fuels will indeed result in catastrophic climate change. According to the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, “we can’t drill our way out” of this supposed problem.	0
This is only one path; storms usually come from the south instead of from the east like Sandy. Scientists agree that future storms will be slightly stronger because of global warming and that sea level is rising faster than researchers once thought. Those factors likely will overwhelm the predicted change in steering currents, he said.	1
The extreme weather events of the 2012, from Superstorm Sandy to an historic drought, are unlikely to shift their priorities, she said. The stark truth is that severe weather events alone will not cause global warming to pop to the top of the national agenda. “Fresh strategies will be needed, based on new understandings of political obstacles and opportunities.” Skocpol, a political scientist, compares the failed push for a climate law unfavorably to the ultimately successful effort to pass health care reform.	1
Still, there is much that can be said here, even though scientists are careful to emphasize the remaining uncertainties: 1. Global warming has added more moisture to the atmosphere, such that for any storm event, including Sandy, there will be more precipitation as a consequence. And excess rainfall is one of the top three sources of hurricane damage (the others being wind and storm surge).	0
The Pentagon has already begun actively planning for a future under climate change, including relocating bases. About half the population of Cambridge, Massachusetts, across the Charles River from Boston and home to Harvard and MIT, could be locked in to a future below sea level by the early 2060s. Several coastal cities in Texas were also vulnerable.	0
"And if seas continue to rise, as projected, another 18 inches of sea level rise is going to cause lots of problems and expense, especially with surge during storms, said study co-author Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. There is such a tight relationship between sea level and temperature. ""I wish there wasn&apos;t, then we wouldn&apos;t be as worried."""	1
By relying upon climate models that do not properly account for the impact of natural influences, the U.N. has greatly overstated the amount of warming that is likely to occur as a result of rising CO2, according to Singer’s team of researchers. Any warming that may occur is likely to be modest and cause no net harm to the global environment or to human well-being. This file picture shows an enormous iceberg (R) breaking off the Knox Coast in the Australian Antarctic Territory on January 11, 2008.	2

"""The drafts became too alarmist,"" Tol told Reuters, acknowledging that some other authors ""strongly disagree with me."" Economic growth and poverty reduction will slow down and global food prices will rise between 3 and 84 percent by 2050 because of warmer temperatures and changes in rain patterns, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press. The report is intended to help governments reach global a climate pact at a U.N. summit in Paris in 2015, according to Reuters."	1
“The ice is weak so it opens up water and allows more sunlight in which warms the water more which makes the ice break up more – so it accelerates the melt. There is hardly any old, multi-year ice left. We are seeing less and less old thick ice,” says Toberg.	1
"China, Russia, and India are not held to the same standards as America.

Oxfam also cites a study that suggested the 2011 drought in East Africa and famine in Somalia were made more likely by climate change. Natural events such as storms, floods, and droughts happen anyway and it is hard to blame particular occurrences on global warming. On this, the panel is expected to say on Friday that extreme weather effects are more likely because of climate change, but will stop well short of attributing specific events solely to climate change.	2
The proposal does not discuss the issue of greenhouse gases which are reportedly a leading cause in climate change. It’s only a temporary Band-Aid covering a problem that will persist essentially forever, actually hundreds of thousands of years for fossil fuel CO2 to finally go away naturally. It will be tempting to continue to procrastinate on cleaning up our energy system, but we’d be leaving the planet on a form of life-support.	0
This actually satisfies a psychological need for many people. It’s just a trick created by pretending that all the scientists who agree that humans make a contribution to global warming (ie almost everyone). Which simply isn’t the case.	2
Drawing on the arguments of Danish environmental renegade Bjørn Lomborg, author of The Skeptical Environmentalist, they argue that tending to the needs of the poor constitutes a greater priority than curbing global warming. There is a humanitarian imperative to meeting these growing global energy needs. Asked why global warming shouldn’t be of greater concern, the Exxon CEO parroted Lomberg’s anti-environmental perspective.	1
The “Statement for the Record” from his testimony contains these gems: We continue to assess that global climate change will have wide-ranging implications for US national security interests over the next 20 years because it will aggravate existing world problems–such as poverty, social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual leadership, and weak political institutions–that threaten state stability. The effects of climate change are accelerating, particularly in the Arctic region and on mountain glaciers that impact critical watersheds. The thawing of the permafrost across vast stretches of Russia, including areas in which there are oil and gas deposits and over which there are pipelines, will both put existing infrastructure at risk and make its modernization and replacement more difficult.	0
Opponents of the plan say it’s another form of socialistic wealth distribution that will dramatically raise energy costs. Energy costs will increase not only because of the tax, but also because energy companies will raise prices across the board knowing that all consumers have more money to spend, thanks to carbon-tax dividends.	1
“This is a real energy revolution,” the Journal noted, “even if it’s far from the renewable energy dreamland of so many government subsidies and mandates.” Other commentaries were similarly focused on the US outpacing Saudi Arabia and Russia, even if some questioned whether the benefits would be as great as advertised or obtainable at an acceptable cost to the environment. Gas prices will not drop significantly because oil is a global commodity and those prices are largely set by international market forces. “[T]he US may be slightly more protected, but it doesn’t give you the energy independence some people claim,” he told the New York Times.	1
"""This is the global threat of our time. And for the sake of future generations, our generation must move toward a global compact to confront a changing climate before it is too late. ""That is our job."	0
If, in 2007, Swetnam was out on a limb, these days it’s likely that the limb has burned off and it’s getting ever easier to imagine the destruction of forests on a region-wide scale, however disturbing that may be. The forests of the western United States account for 20% to 40% of total US carbon sequestration. At some point, as western forests succumb to the ills of climate change, they will become a net releaser of atmospheric carbon, rather than one of the planet’s principle means of storing it.	1
Since the early 1980s, coral cover across the entire Caribbean has plummeted 80 percent, so that living corals now cover only 10 percent, on average, of available surface area. What’s happening there is a microcosm of a global trend: 90 percent of the world’s coral will be at risk of disappearance by 2030, thanks primarily to ocean acidification and global warming, both products of greenhouse gases released by human activity. Tim Austin, an ecologist with the Cayman Department of Environment, has seen this transformation first-hand.	0
"(AP) BERLIN – The cost of keeping global warming in check is ""relatively modest,"" but only if the world acts quickly to reverse the buildup of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, the head of the U.N.&apos;s expert panel on climate change said Sunday. Such gases, mainly CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, rose on average by 2.2 percent a year in 2000-2010, driven by the use of coal in the power sector. Without additional measures to contain emissions, global temperatures will rise about 5 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 compared to current levels, the panel said."	1
“It was really dramatic, but I’m like, ‘Hold on, we need to really measure the soot.” Thus was born the Dark Snow project, in which Box and colleagues are trying to crowd-fund an expedition to sample the ice at high elevations and determine just how much soot from global wildfires and pollution are amplifying Greenland’s melting. Greenland is not only melting. And what’s more, we may be blowing past a point of irreversibility, where the world commits, irrevocably, to a level of sea level rise that, as it unfolds over the coming centuries, would devastate many coastal megacities.	1
The paper, by Dr Zhao Xinhua and Dr Feng Xueshang, adds that a peer-reviewer said the results “provide a possible explanation for the global warming”. The release of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases contributed to 90 percent or even higher of the observed increase in the global average temperature in the past 50 years. However, the new paper casts doubt on the IPCC’s assertion: Research shows that the current warming does not exceed the natural fluctuations of climate.	0
Since human greenhouse gas emissions are a valuable component of the industrial processes that unleash economic activity and raise living standards, doesn’t the Kyoto Protocol put the undeveloped world in more of a compromised position? The threat to humanity comes more from global warming policies. Bonner Cohen, a senior fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has a keen understanding of the U.N.’s motivations.	2
Apparently, temperatures reverting back to pre-Climate Change hysteria norms is proof of Climate Change, or something. Science disagrees with his phony claim that this cold snap has anything to do with Climate Change, Global Warming, or whatever these Truthers are calling it this week. If you want a real laugh, the infamous Polar Vortex Walsh is blaming on Global Warming today is the same infamous Polar Vortex Time Magazine blamed on Global Cooling in 1974.	2
"The international Paris accord climate agreement, from which President Donald Trump withdrew in June, set a goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. The window on keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C is closing rapidly and the current emissions pledges made by signatories to the Paris Agreement do not add up to us achieving that goal. In a statement obtained by CNN, former Vice President Al Gore, who is also an ecological activist, said, ""Today the world's leading scientific experts collectively reinforced what mother nature has made clear — that we need to undergo an urgent and rapid transformation to a global clean energy economy."""	0
Following this debate, I’ve been struck by the strong impression that people are making things too complicated. Global warming made Sandy directly and unmistakably worse, because of its contribution to sea level rise. “I keep telling people the one lock you have here is sea level rise,” meteorologist Scott Mandia explained to me recently.	0
Skocpol, in her analysis, does not offer much cause for optimism. Whatever environmentalists may hope, the Obama White House and congressional Democrats are unlikely to make global warming a top issue in 2013 or 2014. The extreme weather events of the 2012, from Superstorm Sandy to an historic drought, are unlikely to shift their priorities, she said.	1
Rising global temperatures during the 19th and 20th centuries may be linked to greater plant photosynthesis. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California at Merced, estimated based on its models “the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent over the 200-year record captured,” according to an article published on the UC Merced website.	1
That means there will be more sea ice en route and more danger. Summer sea ice in the Arctic will disappear sometime this century. Cover has dropped at a rate of around 13 percent every 10 years for the last few decades.	1
Last month, the coalition demanded that the State Department issue a supplemental environmental impact statement. Expansion of high carbon projects such as the proposed Keystone XL tar sands pipeline will undermine the good work being done in local communities across the country to fight climate change and reduce our dependence on oil. As a result, it will surely become harder to derail the efforts of TransCanada and Koch Industries to ram a pipeline filled with toxic tar sands oil right through David Daniel’s property.	0
“It is my favorite.” Corn _-0-_/Flickr If corn bread, creamed corn, or creamy fried confetti corn are some of your Thanksgiving favorites, you ought to be pretty worried about climate change. In a worst-case global warming scenario, corn, cotton, and soy-bean yields could decrease by 80 percent by 2100. The drought the Midwest saw this summer was the worst in half a century, and the USDA predicts corn yield this year may plummet to around 122 bushels per acre—the lowest since 1995.	1
“There was a time we called it global warming, which meant what it said: the globe would get warmer. We appreciated that a planet running a fever is just like a person running a fever, which is to say it has a whole lot of other symptoms: in this case, droughts, floods, wildfires, habitat disruption, sea level rise, species loss, crop death and more. “Now, you can add yet another problem to the climate change hit list: volcanoes.	0
So like with any high-cost luxury, we should limit our indulgence,” writes Rieder. You could do everything possible to minimize your own carbon footprint. I think the answer is clearly no.” Rieder states that if families having fewer children reduces their contribution to carbon emissions, then they should do so even if that emission has no real-world effect in order to satisfy Rieder’s “morals.” Despite Rieder’s claims that having a large number of children is essentially immoral, he claims that he is not suggesting that parents be shamed or forced to only have a certain number of children; he simply wants to “discuss the ethics of making babies with care and respect.” Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.	0
Any first-generation technology will. But we are looking at carbon the same way we look at every pollutant under the Clean Air Act. We recognize that these power plants are going to be around for decades.	1
The warmists are using falsified results to push their arguments, as Climategate demonstrated. The end goal of this scheme is global governance with the creeps who polluted Copenhagen with their presence as our future overlords. Not appealing in the least.	1

A new Science Advances study modeled the impact of tsunamis based on sea level increases, and discovered worrying results. Rising sea levels allowed tsunamis to reach much further inland, significantly increasing the risk of floods. This means small tsunamis that might not be deadly today could wreak havoc in the future.	1
Much of it is coming from just three states: Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. That means methane may be a bigger global warming issue than thought. Methane is 21 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide, the most abundant global warming gas, although it doesn&apos;t stay in the air as long.	0
For the existing, EPA sets guidelines for what we think is appropriate, but then states develop plans that work for them, taking into consideration their specific energy mix. This will help us begin to more concretely talk about what’s already happening at the state and local level to reduce carbon emissions in the electricity sector. We don’t just have to do it.	0
California government officials have occasionally overhyped the threat to coastal areas. Rising sea levels could force Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to be moved. He was forced to correct that statement after it was pointed out that LAX is at least 108 feet above sea level, and therefore safe from rising seas even under the most extreme scenario.	0
“Much to my surprise, by far the best match came to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, measured from atmospheric samples and air trapped in polar ice,” said Muller. Global warming is caused by human greenhouse gases. In an unconventional move aimed at appeasing climate skeptics by allowing “full transparency,” the results have been publicly released before being peer-reviewed by the Journal of Geophysical Research.	1
Any wavering from this path would signal a significant retrenchment in the global climate struggle. Europe is preparing to rein in the pace of its drive to slow global warming. At issue is not the implementation of the 20-20-20 plan, which is well on its way to being achieved, but on the goals that should follow it.	1
If your pension fund or 401(k) manager invests in fossil-fuel companies, it just might. A third of the world’s oil, coal and other fossil fuel reserves must remain untouched until 2050 to stave off catastrophic climate change. That, naturally, freaked out some investors.	0
He says the landscape changes can be clearly seen from the summit of Everest, which by most measures is the tallest mountain in the world. It used to be more snow and ice, but now it’s more rock. “It’s very dangerous for climbing.” Soot produced by stoves, power plants, brick kilns, and vehicles throughout the region is wafting up and across the Himalayas.	1
Earlier this month, scientists at the University of Wyoming reported finding historical evidence of extreme wildfire seasons in the Rocky Mountain region. Such fires happened hundreds of years ago, after global temperatures had risen slightly. The researchers studied layers of charcoal particles in the sediment beneath ponds in northern Colorado's Mount Zirkel Wilderness, the Casper Star-Tribune reported.	1
He talked about the claim that the war is in part due to severe drought in that area caused by global warming: [The claim is that the Syrian civil war] wouldn’t be happening at all and there would have been the use of chemical weapons if it weren’t for global warming. The Arctic Ice Sheet is at a record size for this time of year. They told us the ice was melting in the Arctic Ice Sheet.	1
This actually satisfies a psychological need for many people. Humans make a contribution to global warming. Which simply isn’t the case.	0
"""Santa’s relocation agreement marks the first time that the international community agrees on a common legal definition of climate change that includes refugees as corporations, as well as individuals,” the post said. This deal is expected to lead to the deployment of a global climate change refugee visa system that in the near future could help to more easily relocate individuals and corporations facing the impacts of climate change. Some climate change alarmists have predicted that billions of people worldwide could become victims of man-made climate change in the near future, forcing them to leave their homeland and move elsewhere."	1
Amid the troubling signs, however, researchers outlined a path to prosperity: large-scale, transnational investment, combined with closely coordinated local and national actions. At the global level, nations must adopt transformative climate change policies. Locally, improved transportation and communication access can help alert residents to dangerous conditions and enable them to find safety.	0
The Nation article is typical in that it makes many bizarre claims in a brief space. A runaway greenhouse effect on Venus led to temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Of course, no one can claim that the earth is subject to such a runaway, but even on Venus, the hot surface depends primarily on the closeness of Venus to the sun and the existence of a dense sulfuric acid cloud covering the planet.	1
A giant reservoir of the greenhouse gas, in the form of gas hydrates on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), could be emitted, either slowly over 50 years or catastrophically fast over a shorter time frame, say the researchers. The ramifications of vanishing ice will also be felt far from the poles. “The imminent disappearance of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will have enormous implications for both the acceleration of climate change, and the release of methane from off-shore waters which are now able to warm up in the summer,” said Prof Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar ocean physics group at Cambridge University and one of the authors of the paper published in the journal Nature.	0
Anthropogenic global warming activists claim that all extreme weather events are somehow related to “global warming,” which has been re-termed “climate change” since global temperatures are no longer warming. Global tropical activity, which can be measured using the ACE Index (Accumulated Cyclone Energy), is near record lows according to peer-reviewed research. But one cannot simply equate global conditions with regional weather events, which is a cornerstone of Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) arguments.	1
Crops would fail, water would dry up, and the lack of stability, coupled with these problems, would cause significant climate-change-related wars. Global warming has already caused significant crises in Africa. “In violence-plagued northern Mali, a desiccated landscape of dust and mud huts where the average rainfall is a third less than it was nearly two decades ago, scholars recently blamed a climate change–induced drought for fueling conflict between Tuareg separatist rebels, who need water and grass for their cattle herds, and government-backed forces.	0
In this way, according to the Chatham House report, climate change is best understood as a “threat multiplier… a key factor exacerbating existing resource vulnerability” in states already prone to such disorders. Climate change will reduce crop output in many areas, sending global food prices soaring and triggering unrest among those already pushed to the limit under existing conditions. “Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as droughts, heat waves, and floods, will also result in much larger and frequent local harvest shocks around the world… These shocks will affect global food prices whenever key centers of agricultural production area are hit—further amplifying global food price volatility.” This, in turn, will increase the likelihood of civil unrest.	0
In 2000 French President Jacques Chirac said in a speech at The Hague that the Kyoto Protocol represented “the first component of an authentic global governance.” Former Vice President Al Gore spoke at Oxford in 2009 on the need to change how we live to save the planet. The real goal in global warming is to redistribute the world’s wealth. “This has almost nothing to do with environmental policy anymore,” Endenhofer said.	2
But at the same time, there has been a vast debate about the true nature of the storm’s connections to global warming (as well as plenty of denialism regarding those connections). Global warming caused Sandy. Systemically.	0
“Just because there was possibly less ice in some areas at other times, that doesn’t mean it’s not human-induced now”. We can expect the Arctic to be ice-free in summer within 20 years. “The ice won’t go away the whole year.	0
The 582 megawatt facility is expected to burn through around 4 million tonnes of low-grade lignite coal a year, all mined from the hills just behind the plant. But the plant will strip out about two-thirds of carbon dioxide emissions, leaving emissions at about the same level as cleaner-burning natural gas. “The carbon footprint is essentially the same or maybe even less than a natural gas plant that doesn’t have carbon capture,” said Randall Rush, the Southern Company engineer who spent 25 years bringing the plant to life.	1
The glaciers feed 10 of the world’s most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy, and directly or indirectly supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air and income. Impacts on people from their melting will range from worsened air pollution to more extreme weather, while lower pre-monsoon river flows will throw urban water systems and food and energy production off-kilter.

Interestingly, at least some climate scientists are already beginning to drop hints about how they might react. Global warning will be overridden by this effect, giving humankind and the Earth 30 years to sort out our pollution. Rather than admit that they might be wrong and that warming could be driven primarily by factors other than carbon-dioxide emissions, Zharkova suggests instead that an extreme cooling period would push the red line people like Al Gore are always ranting about 50 years into the future.	2
"The IPCC summary also refrained from detailed discussions on what level of financial transfers are needed to help developing countries shift to cleaner energy and adapt to climate change.

“Hundreds of American cities are already locked into watery futures and we are growing that group very rapidly,” Strauss said. Each 1 degree Celsius rise in atmospheric warming would lead eventually to 2.3 meters of sea-level rise. The latest study takes those figures, and factors in the current rate of carbon emissions, as well as the best estimate of global temperature sensitivity to pollution.	1
As anybody who has been skiing knows full well, when you are up a mountain and the sun comes out, it can get very warm with the sunlight reflecting of the snow.” The CBS article goes on to quote University of Montana glaciologist Joel Harper, who asserts that Greenland warming up is a problem because “Greenland contributes about 40 percent of current sea level rise.” Nair adds: “Over the past century, the world’s oceans have risen 4 to 8 inches. Sea level rise will be the greatest environmental threat to coastal cities from Miami to Mumbai. However, the annual rate of rise over the past 20 years has been 0.13 inches (3.2 millimeters) a year, roughly twice the average speed of the preceding 80 years.” Yet that statistic was long ago debunked.	0

This week’s doomed furry friend is the emperor penguin, who researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution say could be nearly wiped out by 2100 because of climate change. Dispersal may help sustain global Emperor penguin populations for a limited time.

But if the rising sea level is so catastrophic, why has Gore bought a beachfront mansion? Carbon dioxide – what you are exhaling – is what controls temperature. And climate models have constantly reflected that reality.	1
“Give climate change credit for one thing: it’s endlessly versatile,” Kluger writes breathlessly in his article How Climate Change Leads to Volcanoes (Really). There was a time we called it global warming, which meant what it said. It was only later that we appreciated that a planet running a fever is just like a person running a fever, which is to say it has a whole lot of other symptoms: in this case, droughts, floods, wildfires, habitat disruption, sea level rise, species loss, crop death and more.	1

Most Caribbean coral reefs will disappear within the next 20 years unless action is taken to protect them, primarily due to the decline of grazers such as sea urchins and parrotfish. A comprehensive analysis by 90 experts of more than 35,000 surveys conducted at nearly 100 Caribbean locations since 1970 shows that the region’s corals have declined by more than 50 percent.	1

Big wildfires like Colorado’s thrive in dry air, low humidity, and high winds; climate change is going to make those conditions more frequent over the next century. Large forest fires have occurred more often in the western United States since the mid-1980s as spring temperatures increased, snow melted earlier, and summers got hotter, leaving more and drier fuels for fires to devour. Thomas Tidwell, the head of the United States Forest Service, told a Senate committee on energy and natural resources recently that the fire season now lasts two months longer and destroys twice as much land as it did four decades ago.	0
Climate change is happening – but not because of human activity, Daniel Botkin, professor Emeritus in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology at University of California Santa Barbara has said. Moreover, the focus on man-made global warming is detracting attention from real environmental disasters to nature’s detriment. Writing on the National Parks Traveler, a website dedicated to America’s national parks, Botkin challenges the conclusions reached by the Union of Concerned Scientists in their paper National Landmarks at Risk, How Rising Seas, Floods, and Wildfires Are Threatening the United States’ Most Cherished Historic Sites, not least because they’ve taken the standard reports from the IPCC and others, “treating them as accurate and true,” and then used those results to look at the possible outcome for various national parks.	2
“It’s clear that sometime next year we’ll see 400 consistently,” he said. This will require, at a minimum, slashing the use of fossil fuels. For example, according to Hansen, the world will need to completely stop burning coal by 2030 if returning to 350 ppm is to remain possible.	1

Mind you, the more conservative climate science types, represented by the prestigious Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), paint scenarios that are only modestly less hair-raising, but let’s spend a little time, as I’ve done, with what might be called scientists at the edge and hear just what they have to say. We as a species have never experienced 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. “We’ve never been on a planet with no Arctic ice, and we will hit the average of 400 ppm…within the next couple of years.	1
What was triggered at this blog was the death of unconditional trust in the scientific peer review process, and the maturing of a new movement – that of peer-to-peer review. Just what forced the release of the Climategate files – and as a consequence revealed the uncertainty of the science and the co-opting of the process that legitimizes global warming research. It was a collective of climate blogs, centered on the work of Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick, which applied the pressure.	2
While no single weather event—the cold snaps that caused this year’s pollen vortex, for example—can be directly attributed to global warming, the science community is engaged in a lively debate over whether climate change is making unusual weather events, including severe cold temperatures, more likely. The rapidly warming Arctic has caused the jet stream to slow, which could result in atmospheric events, such as winter storms, staying put for longer. But even if climate change can’t be blamed for this year’s pollen vortex, there is substantial evidence that a warming planet spells a more agonizing allergy season.	0
Photosynthesis is the process of converting carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, which power plants, using sunlight. The leading candidates are rising atmospheric CO2 levels, a result of emissions from human activities; longer growing seasons, a result of climate change caused by CO2 emissions; and nitrogen pollution, another result of fossil fuel combustion and agriculture. In other words, more carbon dioxide, which is being produced by humans at record levels, has improved plant growth, which in turn improves food production for humans and animals.	0
Even if governments take vigorous steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the report concluded, the continuing increase in fossil fuel consumption will result in “a long-term average global temperature increase of 3.6 degrees C.” This should stop everyone in their tracks. An increase of 2 degrees Celsius is about all the planet can accommodate without unimaginably catastrophic consequences: sea-level increases that will wipe out many coastal cities, persistent droughts that will destroy farmland on which hundreds of millions of people depend for their survival, the collapse of vital ecosystems, and far more. An increase of 3.6 degrees C essentially suggests the end of human civilization as we know it.	0
The Generation report follows the publication of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‘s assessment of current global warming science, which set out a “carbon budget” of how much carbon dioxide we can continue to pump into the atmosphere before triggering dangerous levels of warming. There could be as little as 30 years of burning fossil fuels before the threshold is reached. This suggests that many of the world’s remaining fossil fuel resources must be left unexploited if the climate is not to be put in danger, and prominent scientific and political leaders are increasingly calling for this to be recognized.	1
However, if the nation and the world don’t change the way they use energy, “we’re still on the pathway to more damage and danger of the type that are described in great detail in the rest of this report,” said study co-author Henry Jacoby, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This is the most detailed and U.S.-focused scientific report on global warming. “Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present,” the report says.	1
It is hard to understate how big a deal these regulations could be; and while Republicans in the House of Representatives will most assuredly gripe about the EPA’s alleged power grabs, it’s less clear that they can stop them. The science compels action to address the single largest source of carbon pollution in our country. “The clean energy solutions are at hand.	0
The damage is part of a massive bleaching event that has been impacting reefs around the world for the past two years. Bleaching has been triggered by global warming and El Nino, a warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. Hot water puts stress on coral, causing it to turn white and become vulnerable to disease.	0
When it comes to the rest of the planet, however, such concerns, they claim, should be outweighed by a “humanitarian” impulse to provide cheap fossil energy to poor people. Tending to the needs of the poor constitutes a greater priority than curbing global warming. “We must also recognize that there is a humanitarian imperative to meeting these growing global energy needs,” Tillerson typically asserted in 2013.	2
"According to the study, ""the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent"" over the 200 years the record reported. There is no proof that global warming is caused by humans, and no proof that global warming will cause catastrophic issues for Earth. Also, various studies have followed the fluctuating average temperature of the earth, and a study in August 2017 reported that the average climate was actually cooler then than it was when Gore won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work in pushing climate change awareness."	2
"The study was done under the auspices of the Heartland Institute, which claims it ""has no formal attachment to or sponsorship from any government or governmental agency."" The big issue in the global warming debate is how large is the human impact on climate. And this report shows that it is very small, that natural variability, the variability that&apos;s caused by natural cycles of the sun and other factors, way outweigh anything the human impact could have."""	1
In other words, to the extent the public believes in the theory humans are responsible for global warming, it's because they trust the scientists and media outlets they hear from most often on this issue, but should they? Over the past three decades, many climate scientists have repeatedly made a number of significant and alarming predictions about global warming, and the vast majority of the time. As Roy Spencer—who earned his Ph.D. in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin in 1981 and previously served as the senior scientist for climate studies at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center—wrote in 2014, greater than 95 percent of the climate models through 2013 “over-forecast the warming trend since 1979.” It’s common for climate alarmists to argue that global warming has caused and will continue to cause a significant increase in extreme weather events, including hurricanes, and that sea levels will eventually rise to the point that massive cities will someday be flooded and uninhabitable, but the available data say otherwise.	1
He seemed rusty talking about the issue, even saying “carbons” at one point instead of “carbon.” But nonetheless, in a White House press conference last Wednesday, President Obama went the furthest he has gone yet in laying out a climate change agenda for his second term. I am a firm believer that climate change is real, that it is impacted by human behavior and carbon emissions. There were few specifics of the sort that climate watchers wanted to hear, however—and they were justly incensed the next day, when White House press secretary Jay Carney dismissed both the notion of a carbon tax, and tying global warming to Superstorm Sandy (actually, the connection is quite clear and unambiguous).	0
Computer models used by the IPCC to predict warming have shown that the best way to achieve negative emissions is through planting billions of trees to soak up CO2, then burning them in plants fitted with carbon capture and storage systems. Global average temperatures would not rise beyond the crucial 2˚C above preindustrial levels threshold, thought to be the tipping point at which irreversible damage would occur. Currently, only one commercial-scale CCS plant has been built: the Boundary Dam project in Canada, at a cost of £750million.	1
But the Paris pact will become legally important when it is time to defend President Obama’s carbon regulation, the so-called Clean Power Plan, before the U.S. Supreme Court. The supposedly non-binding agreement actually gives the EPA legal authority to regulate carbon emissions. The liberal blog ThinkProgress made this exact argument.	1
Global warming has slowed because of measures taken by the government. Verma’s remarks came in response to Viscount Ridley, a Conservative peer who has questioned government efforts to slow global warming.	2
“The theory is that the CO2 emitted by burning fossil fuel is the ‘greenhouse gas’ causes ‘global warming’ – in fact, water is a much more powerful greenhouse gas and there is 20 time more of it in our atmosphere (around one per cent of the atmosphere) whereas CO2 is only 0.04 per cent. Even the term ‘global warming’ does not mean anything unless you give it a time scale. The temperature of the earth has been going up and down for millions of years, if there are extremes, it’s nothing to do with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it’s not permanent and it’s not caused by us.	2
And that’s just a tiny fraction of what’s to come. 1.6 degrees Celsius (just under 3 degrees Fahrenheit) of temperature rise above pre-industrial levels might be enough to lock in Greenland’s complete melting. Greenland temperatures in summer have already risen a full degree Celsius since the year 2000, and if the soot-related and biological feedbacks that are Box’s current focus turn out to be big enough, the 1.6 degree threshold might also be too conservative.	0
In heat-waves, likely to grow more intense and frequent under climate change, babies and small children are more likely to die or suffer heatstroke because they find it difficult to regulate their body heat. Global warming would cause rapid rises in food prices, causing severe consequences in poor countries. In pointed contrast to climate skeptics, who have seized on some of the areas of uncertainty in the IPCC assessment to claim that global warming is a far-off and minor problem, Oxfam listed recent examples of extreme weather that have caused food shortages and raised prices, quoting scientific estimates that these are likely to increase in number as warming continues.	0
“Bloomberg has done great work with his recent climate plan, to mitigate the impacts of climate and reduce emissions,” Eric Whalen, a field organizer with Environment New York, said on Tuesday afternoon. The winning candidate will continue Bloomberg’s work to mitigate global warming and increase energy efficiency. During the campaign, he praised Bloomberg’s vision, but cautioned that the city must address the specific needs of low-income residents who suffered the worst effects of Sandy.	1
Keep that historical buzz going for a moment to contemplate five sites the National Trust for Historic Preservation—the country’s preserver-in-chief—thinks are most vulnerable to flooding caused by sea level rise. No comprehensive models yet exist to address sea level rise and its threat to historic landmarks. That’s bad, says Anthony Veerkamp, a program director with the Trust, because without first taking stock of what we might lose, “inevitably there will be adaptation strategies that do lesser or greater harm to historic resources.” Here are five sites the Trust are most worried about: 1.	1

Professor Peter Wadhams, a leading Arctic expert at Cambridge University, has been measuring Arctic ice for 40 years, and his findings underscore McPherson’s fears.

With this report, “we can say a little bit more than that now.” Hayhoe, along with an international team of scientists, discovered that climate change will disrupt fire patterns across over 80 percent of the globe by the end of the century. There’s no question that humans have altered the background atmosphere on a global scale. “And there’s also no question humans have altered the environment on the local and regional level” by living near forests and choosing how to manage them.	0
"A warmer climate for even a limited period could profoundly alter meteorological and ecological systems—changes which could perhaps even restrict the ability to produce the biomass on which we might be reliant to reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide content,” he said.

But it’s not just about what we knew—it’s also what we know going forward. If you think this is bad, well, global warming will make it still worse in the future. Take a recent Nature study by climate scientists at MIT and Princeton, looking at future storm surge scenarios under climate change.	0
Think of what’s coming, if you will, as a kind of storm socialism. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide beyond 350 parts-per-million (ppm) could set off compounding feedback loops and so lock us into runaway climate change. We are already at 392 ppm.	0
We can know, therefore, that temperatures and weather conditions have swung dramatically from one side of the spectrum to the other and back again, and, from a historical perspective, when comparing 200 years of industrialization to the 4 billion years the Earth's been around, almost all of the warming and cooling happened before any factory was ever built. CO2 emmissions are dwarfed by the immense amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by natural (and evil, likely Republican) sources like oceans and vegetation. We can further know that the Sun -- which is big enough to eat a million Earths, and hot enough to make you burst into flames from millions of miles away -- really calls the shots in our solar system.	2
Next, you’ll want to follow the right people and institutions: Meteorologist Jeff Masters is talking about the ice that’s hitting Georgia as I write. Today’s ice storm is likely to be more damaging than the January 2000 ice storm, which caused $48 million in losses in north Georgia. “However, it will not compare to the damage from the most expensive ice storm in US history, the great February 1994 Southeast US ice storm.	1
Indeed, sea levels have risen more than 400 feet since the end of the last interglacial period. Skeptics reject the claim global temperatures have risen in recent decades. Virtually everyone agrees temperatures have increased, the primary issue is the reason or reasons for those increases.	1
“We’re looking at a scenario where there’s no more agriculture in California.” NASA has been keeping tabs on California’s disappearing snow melt, a critical resource for the crops, while USDA researchers are racing to breed stoicism into the water-loving leafy greens. Global warming over the next several decades will take place irrespective of any action taken today. Mou told Mother Jones by email that it takes 10 years to develop new breeds, but that becomes less feasible when crops are being starved of their genetic diversity—a situation in turn accelerated by climate change.	0
One may also wonder how no climate scientist was able to predict Hurricane Harvey and yet once it happens they know “almost certainly” that it was aggravated by “human-caused warming.” Fortunately, there are other—more modest—climate scientists who are willing to acknowledge just how much science cannot tell us about climate. Attributing specific climatic events to global warming is simply dishonest. “It is a fundamental fact, although increasingly ignored, that no single climate event or location can be attributed to global warming,” Thresher said.	2
Plus, when looking at a larger picture the modern warm period is nothing compared to what human civilization has lived before. The Arctic see would be ice-free this year. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) also gives a lot of attention to the “unprecedented” melting of the North Pole.	1
The report from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that humans have just 12 years to make huge leaps in innovations to reduce global warming to less extreme levels — or suffer major consequences, Vox reported. The earth is headed for devastating effects of climate change, including deadly flooding, extreme drought, food shortages, the death of coral reefs, and more extreme weather events. The report notes that the earth's surface has warmed about 1 degree Celsius since the pre-industrial period (prior to the Industrial Revolution).	0
But so what? The behavior of arctic sea ice represents one of the numerous interesting phenomena that the earth presents us with, and for which neither the understanding nor the needed records exist. It probably pays to note that melting sea ice does not contribute to sea level rise.	1
In the United States, long before the presence of “global warming,” Americans faced significant hardship in large part because of the severe droughts of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, a major contributor to the Great Depression. The presence of additional carbon dioxide has actually led to better plant growth and crop yields throughout much of the world, including in Africa. In April, The Blaze reported a study published in the journal Nature showed “the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent” during the 19th and 20th centuries, periods of significant warming, with the “leading candidates” of the increased plant growth being “rising atmospheric CO2 levels, a result of emissions from human activities; longer growing seasons, a result of climate change caused by CO2 emissions; and nitrogen pollution, another result of fossil fuel combustion and agriculture.” “The rising CO2 level stimulates crops yields,” said lead researcher of the Nature study Elliott Campbell, a professor at the University of California at Merced.	2
Climate predictions used by scientists, forecasters, and academics have wildly overestimated global warming, forecasting on average two times more warming than actually occurred. As Fox News reports, a study in the science journal Nature Climate Change “compared 117 climate predictions made in the 1990s to the actual amount of warming.” And out of those 117 predictions, according to the study’s author, “three were roughly accurate and 114 overestimated the amount of warming.	2
The EPA says the Kemper County Energy Facility offers a real-life example that it is possible to go on burning the dirtiest of fossil fuels and still make the cuts in carbon dioxide emissions needed to avoid a climate catastrophe. Carbon capture is an unproven technology. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress are moving votes to overturn the entire set of EPA climate rules, based on the argument that carbon capture technology still does not work, and on Wednesday the house of representatives’ science committee is looking at CCS technology.	1
By comparison, the only flooding event in the Western world since the year 2000 was the New Orleans levee disaster of 2005, in which 69 people lost their lives. The best protection against natural disaster is economic development, which allows countries to build flood defences, reinforced buildings, medical care and food stores. In the conclusion to his book Let Them Eat Carbon, Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers’ Alliance commented “Instead of trying to control emissions by rationing energy and thereby limiting economic growth, we should bet on more growth and human ingenuity.	1
Most recently, however—and as Media Matters documents in the helpful video below—conservatives have seized on the bizarre idea that the environmental movement is now saying “climate change” because it can explain anything, including “decades of global cooling,” as one Fox News host claimed. This a sneaky way to cover up the reality that global warming is a sham. Here at Climate Desk, we’ve used the terms pretty much interchangeably.	2
A report in the August 2013 issue of Science revealed that in the near-term Earth’s climate will change 10 times faster than at any other moment in the last 65 million years. The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. “There are potential irreversible effects of melting the Arctic sea ice.	0
It estimates that this could be cut by nearly a third through better farming practices. One of the most effective ways to cut methane is to reduce global populations of ruminant livestock, especially cattle.

We haven’t seen that in the observations,” Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford and one of the study’s authors, told the Times of London, as reported in The Independent. Another 240 billion tons of carbon emissions can be tolerated. “That’s about 20 years of emissions before temperatures are likely to cross 1.5C,” Allen said.	1
“There’s a sense of intimacy with these impending storms that wasn’t around 10 or 15 or 20 years ago,” he says.

The paper stated that there was only a 5% chance that global temperatures will only increase by 2 degrees celsius and will instead likely rise 3.2 degrees Celsius (and possibly by up to 4.9 degrees Celsius) by 2100. If the global temperature did reach an increase of 4 degrees Celsius, this would result in GDP losses of $159 billion a year. Kompas says that this equates to losses of approximately $5,000 for every Australian, every year.	1

Far greater stores of carbon remain trapped in soil and peat layers across the Northern hemisphere, from Canada to Siberia — an amount equal to all the carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere. But the significant warming of the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions in recent decades are drying out these usually moist soil layers. “What we’re seeing is an increased frequency, over the last 10 or 20 years, of severe fire,” Dr. Turetsky said.	0
Debating which storm fits under that umbrella, and which is simply a matter of typical weather fluctuation, does little to help communities cope with either type of storm. Approaching such policy decisions through the less controversial lenses of resilience, risk, adaptation, and disaster preparedness can be a portal to the tougher – and more politically fraught – conversation about mitigation and carbon emissions. “If you start with resilience, there’s so much learning that takes place through that process,” says Michelle Wyman, executive director of the National Council for Science and the Environment, a Washington-based nonprofit that works to improve the scientific basis for environmental decisionmaking.	1
"“From the natural gas production system, there do seem to be leaks coming from … relatively few sources,” meaning emissions could be lowered substantially with each fixed leak, Greenblatt tells the Monitor. Identifying and addressing these ""super-emitters"" could reduce methane emissions from fossil fuels up to 87 percent. To make that happen, President Obama’s aspirational goal to reduce methane by 40 to 45 percent “needs to become a policy with teeth,” he concludes."	1
It’s a very sensitive and important political issue. We can see what the new economy would look like: solar and wind energy replacing fossil fuels. The great thing about solar energy is how much you use today has no effect on how much is available tomorrow.	1
The Internet relies on millions of physical servers in data centers around the world, connected by undersea cables, switches, and routers, all requiring a great deal of energy to run. Internet activity results in as much carbon emissions as the global aviation industry. Google has released reports about its carbon footprint, and has designed more energy-efficient data centers, invested in clean energy, and has launched numerous carbon-offset programs.	1
The Keystone XL pipeline, if approved, would cut global oil prices. For many on the left, that’s the bad news.	1
"""What we have to do is stop pointing fingers about who's at fault and saying whose responsibility it is to fix it and recognize it's all our fault and it's all our responsibility to fix it."" I also support cap and trade of carbon emissions. ""And I was disappointed that the Senate rejected a carbon counting system to measure the sources of emissions, because that would have been the first and the most important step toward implementing true cap and trade."""	0
"David Ige signed two bills that will expand ""strategies and mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions statewide"" and find ways to better capture and store ""atmospheric carbon dioxide to mitigate climate change,"" a process known as carbon sequestration. Hawaii is committed to environmental stewardship, and we look forward to working with other states to fight global climate change. The two laws incorporate sections of the Paris agreement, giving the state ""legal basis to continue adaptation and mitigation strategies for Hawai‘i, despite the federal government’s withdrawal from the treaty,” State Sen."	0
Monmouthshire MP and climate realist David Davies crashed today’s parliamentary launch of the Committee on Climate Change’s new report and used the opportunity to ask some awkward questions. Short periods of minor global warming could be considered significant, while similar periods of cooling or stagnation could be ignored by the scientific community. Describing the meeting chaired by green energy tycoon Lord Deben, Davies said: “…it was a great big love-in, with about 150 Greens.	1
These compounds – most often used in refrigerators and air conditioners – are the world’s fastest-growing greenhouse gases. Cutting the artificial pollutants, which have a warming effect 1,600 times more powerful than carbon dioxide on average, would be a straightforward step toward meeting the Paris Agreement goal to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Now, with the meetings in Kigali concluded, attention has turned to implementation.	0
“The two biggest myths are, it doesn’t matter to me, and there’s nothing we can do to fix it,” says Hayhoe. Indicators like carbon dioxide levels or global temperature are most useful when they’re put in the right context. “A random factoid that suggests the world is going to hell in a handbasket, or that it’s going there even faster than we thought, is likely to raise some people’s anxiety levels, but not likely to help them think about what options they have for doing something about it,” says Edward Maibach, director of George Mason University’s Center for Climate Change Communication.	1
The technologies either exist or are in the advanced stages of development to get that done. The moment we put real limits and real charges on carbon dioxide emissions, we will see a surge of innovation that will discover even better ways for reducing those emissions. The notion that this is going to be unaffordable and an economic catastrophe to address this problem is just wrong.	0
But they feel they have to pay lip service to her existence, nonetheless, because custom and form require it. There is next to no scientific evidence anywhere to back up their doomsday predictions of catastrophic man-made global warming. So desperate are they, in fact, that they’re even resorting to saying stuff that is the exact opposite of true, like this recent headline in the Observer (the Guardian‘s Sunday sister paper).	2
This is a problem because scientists can&apos;t predict how much extra carbon would escape into the atmosphere if a forest was destroyed or if planting new trees would be enough to offset the emissions. One of the most poorly quantified components of the carbon cycle is the net balance between forest disturbance and regrowth. GEDI&apos;s lidar instrument works by shooting streams of light particles at the Earth that then reflect back and are picked up by a detector.	1
“I understand these gases to be a factor in rising temperature, but I do not believe the scientific consensus supports their characterization as the ‘key’ factor.” In reality, the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that synthesized thousands of climate studies to examine the physics behind a warming atmosphere concluded that increased carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning coal, oil, and natural gas, caused the “largest contribution” to global warming, followed by other greenhouse gases that are likewise emitted by human industry. Carbon dioxide contributes to warming. “Many people in the press, when they wrote about his statements at the hearing, interpreted it as, ‘Hey, this guy thinks climate change is happening,’” Leiserowitz told BuzzFeed News.	0
In this case, the summary wasn’t merely “sexed up” to fool gullible reporters and politicians; it actually direct contradicts the full U.N report in places. Global warming might increase the chances of violent conflict. It’s more likely that sustained conflict leads to poor environmental stewardship than the reverse.	0
[includes rush transcript] AMY GOODMAN: The issue of global warming has been in the news a lot recently. The global warming debate is over. It presented a detailed report to the United Nations to combat global climate change.	2
“The need is to reduce deforestation.” Beverly Law, a professor of forest science at Oregon State University, found another hole in Mr. Rohrabacher’s logic. Roughly 75 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions from the natural world come not from above-ground biomass, but from the soil. “You don’t even want to give this guy another wacky idea, but he forgot about soil,” Dr. Law said.	1
What we can say is that it’s precisely this kind of event which the people have been warning against climate change have been warning about. If there is warming, global warming we are going to see a lot more storms and there will be a lot more violent when they occur. Now, of course, this is caused enormous grief and upset and damage to people in the United States but at the same time as that’s been going on, there’s been some far graver things happening in other parts of the world.	1
"""Of the six case studies, some of them could have perhaps been helped with some management intervention, although equally one of the lessons which is a little bit frightening is that potentially it's a little bit out of our hands."" The only way this can be addressed is to act quickly and reduce carbon emissions. ""The faster we can get greenhouse gas emissions down, the lower [the] ultimate increase in temperature."	0
In one projected event, large parts of the ice sheet melt and drain into the ocean over the next millennia, raising global sea levels by several tens of meters. If global warming did not exceed the 2 degree Celsius benchmark, the millennial sea-level rise from the melting of Antarctic ice could likely be restricted to a few meters. And if all currently available fossil fuel resources were released, the model shows the Antarctic Ice Sheet melting entirely.	1
They also calculated the atmospheric changes that would be produced by burning off the estimated stock of Earth's fossil fuel reserves, finding that it would result in a planetary apocalypse. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize adaptation to climate change. Such a scenario, with average temperatures rising 16 degrees Celsius on land and 30 degrees Celsius at the poles, would leave just a fraction of humanity clinging to life atop Earth's highest ridges, Hansen et.	0
“It is not hypocritical to use fossil fuels in order to try to get ourselves off of fossil fuels, particularly since this is simply unavoidable!” David Frank, NYU assistant professor of environmental studies, told FoxNews.com by email earlier this week. Divestment will not noticeably hurt oil company stocks because, when a university sells its fossil-fuel stock and the price falls, independent traders see that the stock has become undervalued and snap it up. But supporters say their goal is simply to send a message.	1
"Trump has been light on the details of his energy policy, though he recently told supporters in West Virginia that the coal industry would thrive if he were president. Global warming is a concept ""created by and for the Chinese"" to hurt U.S. business. Clinton, meanwhile, has advocated shifting the country to 50 percent clean energy by 2030, promised heavy regulation of fracking, and said her prospective administration would put coal companies ""out of business."""	2
A new global report from scientists amounts to an urgent call for the world to act more quickly and forcefully to counter fast-rising threats from climate change. Humanity’s window for action is quickly closing, if the goal of holding global warming to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial averages is to be met. And the report emphasized the benefits of aiming for that target, rather than allowing temperatures to rise 2 degrees C or more due to the buildup of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.	0
“This is a tragedy not only for some of the world’s most biodiverse coral reefs, but also for people in the region, many of whom are extremely impoverished and depend on these reefs for their food and livelihoods,” Caleb McClennen, marine program director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in a statement. Steadily warming seas pose a similar threat to reefs in other areas. This year bleaching events were recorded in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Malaysia and other parts of Indonesia.	0
Enjoy the cartoon, stay safe and check out the links behind the ‘toon. The science is anything but settled on global warming.

"The rising temperatures in the Arctic are affecting permafrost and snow cover as well as the amount of sea ice, which this year was the second-lowest on record. The sea ice is building up much slower than normal as winter approaches. ""There are still huge areas in the Barents Sea and Kara Sea to the east of Svalbard that are free of ice,"" he said."	1

The poll found nearly half of Americans believe climate change is harming the US right now. Climate impacts are playing out across the US, from damaging wildfires to increased heavy rain and flooding to rising seas. “We’re the first generation to feel the sting of climate change.	0
No signal had emerged in the atmosphere to suggest a sharp rise in methane emissions from the Arctic. But that does not mean all is stable with methane in the air — quite the contrary, in fact.	1
AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask not only about what’s happening in the Southwest, but a vicious cycle you talked about that could do everything from ignite tropical forests to melt the Arctic tundra. Once warming reaches a certain point, the amount of assistance that we’re getting in terms of carbon storage from the land and oceans tends to go down. And this is quite clear from the IPCC models, and it’s clear from a number of other more recent lines of work.	0
Global leaders finally address the climate crisis. The actor and environmental activist was recently nominated by the United Nations to receive the prestigious “Messenger of Peace” award, with which he will be honored at the UN Climate Summit in New York on Sept. 23.	0
God: bitch I sent you scientists. Global warming isn't real Leo. Climate change?	2
With the Earth Institute study pointing to carbon dioxide emissions as the main issue in the warming trend, resulting in extremely hot summers and higher average temperatures, the scientists’ suggestions of the rapid reduction of CO2 emissions and “international cooperation in generating more affordable carbon-free energies” could prove to be beneficial solutions. The measure of introducing a carbon tax should be adopted soon. Many companies and countries are already working to eliminate carbon in their systems, and the ideas of carbon taxes and caps are supported worldwide.	0
DR. DREW SHINDELL: Again, no. Satellite data disputes global warming. Is this scientifically valid?	2
There will be people everywhere putting up solar panels, insulating houses, etc., all with a 350 theme. We’re going to solve global warming. It’s to say, symbolically, “if we can do this kind of work, then our leaders can do their work.	0
"How does it happen that a whole generation of scientific experts is blind to obvious facts?"" Pollution caused by fossil fuels has been conflated with climate change. “Coal is very unpleasant stuff, and there are problems with coal quite apart from climate,” he said."	2
Global temperature data sets show that 2010 was one of the two warmest years in the historical record. Climate change and ocean acidification, caused when carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans, pose a far more serious threat and could ultimately lead to the total collapse of many reefs. How are climate change, scarcer resources, population growth and other challenges reshaping society?	0
He says that expected warming is in the sweet spot for where action makes sense. Climate sensitivity is high enough to demand action, but not so high that it is too late to avoid dangerous global climate change. CLIMATE CHANGE BRINGS NEEDED RAIN TO AFRICA Some skeptics say that the new analysis relies on too many assumptions to be confident about its results.	0
About 450 scientists from around the world helped write the report and in it NOAA highlighted one of the lesser-known measurements, ocean heat content. About 93 percent of the heat energy trapped by greenhouse gases — such as carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and gas — goes directly into the ocean. And ocean heat content hit record levels both near the surface and deep.	1
We conclude that a 2°C limit on global warming is not a safe “guardrail.” But that’s not why it made headlines, including in the Washington Post and on CBS Evening News earlier this week. Continued high emissions will make multi-meter sea level rise practically unavoidable and likely to occur this century. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea level rise could be devastating.	0
But overwhelming scientific consensus says they are actually the result of human-induced climate change and irresponsible construction in flood-prone areas. Global warming is causing sea levels to rise, while increasing the frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme weather events. At the same time, the rapid urbanization of coastal areas is putting more people and property in harm’s way.	0
The estimates vary from year to year. Over 24 million people around the world fled their homes (some temporarily) because of extreme events like floods and drought and other environmental disasters, according to the report. In 2010, the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimated that more than 42 million people “were forced to flee due to disasters triggered by sudden-onset natural hazards,” the United Nations report said.	0
Because the sun’s magnetic field controls how many cosmic rays reach Earth’s atmosphere (the stronger the sun’s magnetic field, the more it shields Earth from incoming cosmic rays from space), the sun determines the temperature on Earth. Cosmic rays and the sun play an integral role in global warming. Mr. Kirkby…convinced the CERN bureaucracy of the theory’s importance and developed a plan to create a cloud chamber — he called it CLOUD, for “Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets.” Alas, Solomon notes, Kirkby repeated, …the same tactical error that the Danes [the two Danish Space Research Institute scientists who put forth the theory in 1996] had — not realizing how politicized the global warming issue was, he candidly shared his views with the scientific community.	1
For starters, Mr. Anderegg’s dissertation advisers are Christopher Field and Stephen H. Schneider, two of the most prominent advocates of the mainstream view of climate change; Dr. Schneider is a co-author of the new paper. Global-warming science is an echo chamber in which, they contend, it is hard to get published if one does not accept the conventional wisdom that humans are heating up the planet. So they argue that it is circular reasoning to claim a broad scientific consensus based on publication track records.	2
The “polar vortex” is blasting cold air normally found around the North Pole into the middle of the country. Global warming is to blame. Although this climate link is still under debate, what’s indisputable is that over the coming years and decades, climate change will harm much of the inland United States.	0
JOHN HOLDREN: Well, I think the answer, first of all, is for the world to agree, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which goes forward and has negotiations every year and will embrace in 2009 in Copenhagen a new set of rules for the whole world. We have a global agreement on how we are going to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, going forward, and an agreement that will include the tropical forest, that will include ways to transfer some of the revenues from carbon taxes or carbon emission permits in the north to pay for reduced deforestation in the south. We need a variety of measures in this global agreement, going forward, which will get everybody on the same page and which will lead to the global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases starting to decline in absolute terms no later than 2020.	1
But this time, even as the report prompted social-media reactions of “we’re doomed” or “we’re cooked,” other shifts may give a nudge toward hope and engagement. The reduction of fossil-fuel emissions look more feasible. And, from droughts and wildfires to storms and floods, the “lived experience” of many people in the past few years is making action look more necessary.	1
So it will be reviewed with the highest standard in mind, and that review is ongoing right now. Rich countries should bear a greater burden than developing ones in reducing emissions and helping countries cope with global warming. Liu Zhenmin, deputy chief of the Chinese delegation, told reporters Friday the issue is “at the core of our concern for the Paris agreement.” He said he wants different rules for different countries “clearly stipulated” in a deal that may be finalized Saturday.	0
The hidden health and environmental costs of using fossil fuels are far greater than previously thought. In a report released Monday, IMF economists estimated that global energy subsidies this year could cost more than $5 trillion, about $10 million a minute — greater than the combined health spending of governments worldwide in 2013.	0
In June, David Whitehouse of the Global Warming Policy Foundation wrote, “The absence of any significant change in the global annual average temperature over the past 16 years has become one of the most discussed topics in climate science. Of course, climate change advocates are trying their best to offer an explanation for the lack of global warming. As Reuters environment correspondent Alister Doyle cited from the report: Scientists believe causes could include: greater-than-expected quantities of ash from volcanoes, which dims sunlight; a decline in heat from the sun during a current 11-year solar cycle; more heat being absorbed by the deep oceans; or the possibility that the climate may be less sensitive than expected to a build-up of carbon dioxide.	2

But proponents, who applaud the senate’s vote, say there is no hypocrisy. It is not hypocritical to use fossil fuels in order to try to get ourselves off of fossil fuels, particularly since this is simply unavoidable.

Antarctica is overall accumulating ice. Still, areas of the continent, like the Antarctic Peninsula photographed above, have increased their mass loss in the last decades.	2
It is unclear whether this mega-meltdown would be reversible, and on what timescales, the authors note. Unrestrained carbon emissions could cause extreme sea level rise over the next one thousand years. By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion.	0
But what plays well with the morally-superior Hollywood rich and famous, and liberal elitist career politicians, does not seem to play as well with the rest of reality-minded Americans, who must worry about being able to pay their bills each month. Only 6 percent of Americans are willing to pay $1,000 or more annually in higher taxes and utility costs to subsidize the cost of adding more sustainable energy to fight global warming. 26 percent are willing to pay $300 a year, or $25 per month; another 24 percent are only willing to pay $100 a year, or $8.33 per month; 41 percent of Americans are not willing to pay anything more, or $0.00 per month; and 3 percent gave no answer.	1
Related: UN climate chief: Deal to reduce emissions within reach The study could be used by the Obama Administration to counter concerns about the cost of its Clean Power Plan, which requires states to cut their carbon emissions mostly from coal-fired power plants 32 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. A transition to a reliable, low-carbon, electrical generation and transmission system can be accomplished with commercially available technology and within 15 years. While the costs of wind and solar have become increasingly competitive, they remain dogged by fears that they cannot consistently supply power.	1
Not everyone is happy that California is so aggressive in pursuing its own climate agenda.

One attempt to provide a long-term forecast came last month when a pair of seismologists suggested a possible earthquake forecast at the Geological Society of America annual meeting. 2018 and the following four years could bring an increase of earthquakes over magnitude 7 globally. This forecast isn’t meant to scare anyone, says Rebecca Bendick, a geoscientist at the University of Montana in Missoula and one of the researchers behind the latest forecast.	0
The authors used two warming scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, one based on a medium-to-high-range level of carbon emissions in the future and another one based on a lower set of carbon emissions. Already Yellowstone, which sits at a relatively high average elevation of 8,000 feet above sea level in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, is warming faster than the rest of the globe. The temperature there over the last decade was 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average temperature in the region for the 20th century, the report said.	0
"""One of the greatest challenges as a scientist doing research on climate change and food is to illustrate it in a way that people can understand,"" U.S. Department of Agriculture scientist Lewis Ziska told the Associated Press in an email. Few people would complain if global warming ruined Brussels sprouts. In various parts of the world, the decreases could be starker than others, such as an estimated 32 percent decline in Argentina."	1
“We live in a country that is historically one of the largest contributors to climate change so, since the Industrial Revolution, we’ve had certain countries benefit from emissions whereas other countries have not benefited. The countries that are paying the price for industrialization are actually in the Global South, and especially South Asia. At Brown and Green, a loose network that includes teachers and engineers, members have not only marched and rallied but also joined local activists across the bay in Richmond, California, in fighting to reduce pollution from the large Chevron refinery there.	1
"That recalibration could effectively weaken the European Union's commitment and focus on addressing climate change, Guy Edwards, co-director of the Climate and Development Lab at Brown University in Providence, R.I., wrote in an opinion piece published by The Boston Globe. Achieving global prosperity especially for the most vulnerable and poorest depends in large measure on whether the Paris Agreement succeeds or not. ""Brexit would make realizing that goal significantly tougher."""	1
Human contribution so far to sea level rise does not seem particularly significant, given the early 20th century rate of sea level rise is about the same as the current rate. Our ways of inferring future rates of sea level rise from ice sheet melting is crude . The danger posed by sea level rise is a function of the rate of change far more than the actual sea level itself.	0

“One of the study’s most important findings is that not only are regime shifts occurring, but there is a real risk that one regime shift could trigger others, or simultaneous regime shifts could have unexpected effects,” said Johan L. Kuylenstierna, executive director of the Stockholm Environment Institute. Human-induced climate change from outside the Arctic such as burning of fossil fuels is a key factor. From Canada to Iceland, some Arctic communities reliant on traditional whaling and reindeer herding have already adapted to the new normal, the report shows, moving away from their role as nomadic hunters.	0

Such price signals, unlike specific government mandates, allow markets to determine which solutions are the cheapest path to less carbon. You can reach any carbon goal using market-based policies.

Global warming, by increasing precipitation and melting Arctic ice, could eventually destabilize the Gulf Stream, the ocean conveyor belt that carries tropical waters into the North Atlantic and warms Western Europe.

Another common sense reason for rejecting the President’s alarmist (and model-based) vision of Earth’s climatic future is that they are unsupported by numerous observations. The rate of sea level rise is not accelerating and may even be decelerating. What is more, multiple studies reveal the stability of small-island States, many of which are not losing, but actually gaining, ground despite continued sea level rise.	2

Dealing with global warming has become normal, and that’s a good thing. Gone is the “seal the deal” language, aiming for some grand top-down accord, in the months before the failed Copenhagen talks in 2009.	1
“My guess is that it will simply grow back — the Larsen C is not close to the instability that we saw in the ice shelves to the north before they disintegrated,” Scambos said, referring to the melting and fracturing of two neighboring ice shelfs to the north, called Larsen A and Larsen B. Global warming is triggering bigger structural changes to this corner of Antarctica. Scientists will also be also be watching how fast different parts of the glacier are flowing and whether new features appear, such as water pooling on the surface of the glacier due to melting, that may point to climate change, according to Christopher Shuman, a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.	0
The threat to reefs from warming seas is hardly hypothetical: in 2010, one of the warmest years on record, spiking water temperatures damaged coral on a global scale rarely witnessed before. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide, is absolutely necessary if we want any hope of preventing a lot of the dire situations that are presented in the report. Still, local human impacts like overfishing and pollution remain the most pressing threat for reefs, the report noted.	0
"""Climate change and environmental concerns are definitely a strong motivator for people eating more plant-based food … for the health of the planet there are compelling reasons to reimagine the food we use to fuel our bodies,"" said Chalk. Cutting out meat from an individual's diet reduces their greenhouse gas emissions by 35%, and substituting carbon-intensive meats such as beef and lamb with chicken or pork can reduce one person's emissions contribution by 18. A study published in October last year, led by Oxford University, observed the global impact of food consumption on the environment with data from every country and suggested that the average person must eat 75% less beef and 90% less pork to prevent the global rise in temperature above 2ºC this century."	1

His stance helped him to turn coal-involved Pennsylvania into a swing state (and win it), and it helped bolster a wider blue-collar appeal that proved central to his election victory. Coal jobs are going to be hard to revive, even by a president-elect who voiced concern about carbon emissions or climate change. “These three nominees certainly represent a Trump administration that is going to pursue an ‘all of the above’ energy policy, and it's going to be particularly favorable toward the oil and gas industry,” predicts Varun Sivaram, an energy security expert in Washington at the Council on Foreign Relations.	1
If all the land ice on the planet were to melt, it would raise sea levels about 197 feet, he added. Some of the melting that has already occurred is likely irreversible, and could take hundreds of years to reverse.

“Peter Wadhams, who heads the Polar Ocean Physics Group at the University of Cambridge… believes that the Arctic is likely to become ice-free before 2020 and possibly as early as 2015,” Yale Environment 360 reported in 2012.

Behind the changes to the climate is human activity, Holdren said. These phenomena are consistent with the ongoing changes in global climate, which we know with very high confidence are being caused mainly by the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses released by human activities.

That and the fact that NASA has had a nearly 9 year hurricane free window in Florida to not worry about launches.” Despite repeated assertions that man-made climate change is negatively impacting human populations (“Global warming is happening now … our planet is warming and natural systems are struggling to keep up,” intones the National Wildlife Federation), satellite evidence actually shows that there has been no increase in global temperature for 18 years. The sea is not rising. Furthermore, “It hasn’t risen in 50 years.” Mörner calls the predictions of catastrophic sea level rise “the greatest lie ever told”.	2

I think such language is both selfish and counterproductive.” (It should be noted that neither Mr. McIntyre nor Dr. McKitrick nor Mr. Fuller are climate scientists, and that many in the climate science community vehemently reject their critiques of Dr. Mann’s work as flawed and biased. Global temperatures are warmer now than at any time in at least the last 1,000 years. Other climate contrarians like John Christy, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Alabama well known for his minority view that carbon dioxide emissions pose little threat to the climate, warn that Mr. Cuccinelli’s effort to subpoena research documents in the midst of a heated scientific debate could open the door to a dangerous politicization of science.	1
The news is a blow to hopes that emissions had peaked, and to efforts to keep global warming below 1.5°C, as agreed in the Paris climate accords. After three years of little to no growth in total global carbon emissions, 2017 will see a relatively major spike. The precise figure is unknown, partly because the year is not yet complete and partly because there is uncertainty in the statistics, but emissions are expected to be between 1% and 3% higher than 2016, with a best estimate of 3%.	1
But that means that California, like New York, still relies heavily on fossil fuels: natural gas for electricity, plus of course gasoline in transportation. Human emissions are behind observed warming in the Earth’s surface temperatures and oceans, and that action to reduce greenhouse emissions is an urgent global priority. California and New York are arguably America’s leaders on this front, as large states that have set ambitious goals.	0
“Too many people see climate change as a coastal issue,” said Julie Cerqueira, executive director of the US Climate Alliance, a governor-led group responding to the climate crisis. The impacts of sea level rise are so clear and so targeted. “It is much harder to pinpoint one driver of impacts in the Midwest because you’ve got so many things interacting.” The impacts range from the shifting ranges of plants and animals to longer pollen seasons and even a cross-country ski race canceled due to lack of snow.	0
"Steve Nerem, a geophysicist at NASA and the University of Colorado, Boulder, said the world is all but certain to see a three foot sea level rise due to the concentration of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. Even if global emissions stopped immediately, the effects of CO2 already in the atmosphere would lead to rising sea levels, in a sort of ""inertia"" effect. The ocean rise could hit three feet by 2100 or later, Nerem said."	1
The three just last week circulated draft legislation that would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from issuing any regulations on greenhouse gases beyond those already written for vehicles. The science is uncertain and the costs of reining in carbon dioxide and other emissions will be too high. Yet in their brief they say there is no need for judicial intervention because Congress and the administration are already dealing aggressively with the matter.	2
"The contractor claimed that building the pipeline will not affect the climate, which the film points out was based on the assumption that Canada's tar sands will be tapped regardless. Tapping the one of the largest pools of carbon on the planet ""will be game over for the climate"" due to the elevated concentration of carbon dioxide in the tar sands. ""If we were to fully exploit this new oil source, and continue to burn our conventional oil, gas and coal supplies, concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eventually would reach levels higher than in the Pliocene era, more than 2.5 million years ago, when sea level was at least 50 feet higher than it is now,"" Hansen wrote in a New York Times op-ed."	0
One attendee called the presence of big business at the meetings “amazing,” noting that not just Asian and European but American big business attended in force, including representatives from Dupont, Monsanto, and Kellogg. The Paris summit would help trigger a shift away from fossil fuels and encourage greater investments in renewable energy. The Stowe Global Coal Index, which tracks the stock performance of twenty-six major producers, has lost 59 percent of its value this year.	1
"The paper, published Monday, concludes that energy-related decisions being made by today's government leaders will ultimately ""determine the fate of humanity."" Earth's climate-regulating systems may be more sensitive to higher levels of carbon than scientists previously suspected. They also calculated the atmospheric changes that would be produced by burning off the estimated stock of Earth's fossil fuel reserves, finding that it would result in a planetary apocalypse."	0
Stanford’s Board of Trustees chastised the divestment movement by adding that fossil fuels have not only helped lift millions around the world out of poverty by providing cheap and easy access to energy, but energy companies have also been widely recognized for the critical role they play in reducing the U.S. carbon footprint through innovation, production and research. A credible case can be made for divesting from the fossil fuel industry. The university emphasized that they are committed to environmental initiatives that have a tangible effect on climate change and the university’s carbon footprint, such as Stanford’s high-tech greenhouse gas-reducing energy system, off-campus solar plant and a cutting edge climate research center that addresses a range of environmental and sustainability challenges.	1
The probe by this team takes the timeline on Exxon’s focus on climate change several years earlier than a previous investigation of oil industry assessments of global warming by the Union of Concerned Scientists. In the first place, there is general scientific agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil fuels. It was July 1977 when Exxon’s leaders received this blunt assessment, well before most of the world had heard of the looming climate crisis.	1
Still, the fact that the US isn’t going to meet its current pledge will make a big difference to what the Paris deal can achieve. The rise in global temperatures should be kept within 2 degrees Celsius of the pre-industrial average by 2100. Even with the Obama administration’s pledge, the planet was poised to warm by 3.3 degrees C, according to Climate Interactive, a nonprofit that calculates the effects of climate policies, working closely with scientists at MIT.	1
One of the two regions of the world most closely identified with frozen water could have almost none of that left for a good portion of the year by 2012. A warning sign that some scientists worry could mean global warming has passed an ominous tipping point. “One even speculated that summer sea ice would be gone in five years.” Never one to let facts get in the way of its agenda, the Bush Administration is relentlessly battling the “reality-based” community in Bali.	0
These include large-scale biofuel plantations, genetically engineered “supercrops,” synthetic biology, unworkable yet lucrative carbon offset schemes and something called geoengineering, whereby scientists would turn the globe into a giant experiment by injecting newfangled materials into the atmosphere to try to counteract global warming. Global warming can be tackled without changing entrenched patterns of production and consumption in industrialized societies. Even worse, they assume that the multifaceted ecological and societal crises that we face today can be addressed without confrontation, sacrifice or trade-offs.	2
[I also just caught up with Amanda Little’s New Yorker piece on the challenges in separating signal from noise at the climate negotiations.] Global warming doesn’t exist in a news vacuum. Thank you.	2
“Is it fair to do that so we can go on burning fuel as fast as we can?” Caldeira told me recently that he considered this study his most important work and hopes it will help convince world leaders and the public of the scope of what’s being sacrificed for the sake of cheap fossil energy now. ’s poorer nations have few affordable choices other than fossil fuels.

The movement began with 16-year-old environment activist Greta Thunberg, who in August last year started skipping school on Fridays to protest outside Sweden's parliament. Human-made climate change is a real and urgent threat, one that's already playing out in the form of rising seas and warming temperatures. According to Thunberg's latest update, strikes and marches are planned in 105 countries today, including what is expected to be the first large-scale events in the US.	0
The situation in Houston, however, is far from typical. The flood area is so far and wide that it is acting like part of an ocean, feeding warm moisture up into Harvey. Adding to this rare confluence of meteorological circumstances is Houston’s unique layout.	1
However, the greatest long-term threat caused by his administration is that not only is it failing to take action to stop climate change, but it is actually taking steps to make the problem worse. The Trump Administration rejects science, ignores the reality of climate change, and pursues policies that are directly leading to more carbon emissions and a major exacerbation of the crisis. On behalf of its friends in the fossil fuel industry, the administration is doing exactly the opposite of what must be done.	0
But in any case, one of the people who was having a bit of a shot at Al Gore was a man called Dr. William Gray, and he spoke at the University of North Carolina within just a couple of days of me speaking. The human impact on the atmosphere is just too small to have a major effect on global temperatures. And those sort of assertions really need to be tackled and explained, because so many people just accept that from a professor as a given and accept it as a credible sort of statement.	2
The fossil fuel industry may be emitting twice as much methane as previously thought. After carbon dioxide, methane is considered the second biggest source of manmade greenhouse gases.	1
The pieces now breaking off the ice shelves, however, are now bringing massive icebergs in the Western Arctic Ocean as well. This is an area of the world where temperatures are rising very rapidly and the ice shelves are responding. How are climate change, scarcer resources, population growth and other challenges reshaping society?	0
"""We've known that the margins around Antarctica experience surface melting today – in some places like the Antarctic Peninsula this melt has been quite intense,"" he adds.

India continues to suffer from high inflation in food prices and widespread chronic hunger. Such problems will be vastly worse if global temperatures continue to rise. “For every one degree Celsius rise in mean temperature, the wheat loss is estimated to be of the order of six million tons per year,” he said, according to The Hindu newspaper.	0
In a new video to be posted on the official White House website Wednesday, President Obama's science adviser, John Holdren, warns against buying into the idea that a cold snap disproves that the earth is getting warmer overall. If you've been hearing that extreme cold spells, like the one we're having in the United States now, disproves global warming, don't believe it. The two-minute clip puts the Obama administration at odds with conservatives and Republicans who have said the bitterly cold week in much of the United States proves their point that climate change isn't real.	0
Instead, the signatories of the June 1, 2015 dispatch were chief executives of some of the world’s most carbon-intensive companies – oil supermajors like BP, Eni, and Statoil – companies that profit enormously from the very fuels carbon pricing aims to curtail. Pricing carbon obviously adds a cost to our production and our products. Others noted that only European firms signed on, representing just one slice of a sprawling international oil and gas industry.	1
“Increasing carbon emissions in the atmosphere are having a warming effect.” Given the turn the Republican Party took away from acknowledging global warming nearly a decade ago, when Newt Gingrich said “our country must take action to address climate change,” Tillerson was one of the only Trump nominees to publicly maintain that climate change was, in his words, an “important global issue.” When asked during his confirmation hearing if he, now retired from the company, will “still personally stand by” Exxon’s position, Tillerson said “I do not take exception to that statement,” before adding “I might articulate it a little different as to my personal views.” Indeed, Tillerson did give a different articulation in one of his written responses, saying increasing carbon emissions were not “key” to understanding the rise in global temperatures. I agree with the consensus view that combustion of fossil fuels is a leading cause for increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “I understand these gases to be a factor in rising temperature, but I do not believe the scientific consensus supports their characterization as the ‘key’ factor.” In reality, the 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that synthesized thousands of climate studies to examine the physics behind a warming atmosphere concluded that increased carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning coal, oil, and natural gas, caused the “largest contribution” to global warming, followed by other greenhouse gases that are likewise emitted by human industry.	0
In truth, people of faith have played important roles in environmental causes for generations. Devout Americans are generally less likely to be concerned about global warming than their nonreligious peers. But among Catholics this may be starting to change.	1
"Dr. Trusel, a professor of Geology at Rowan University in Glassboro, N.J., tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email that meltwater rivers are similar to rivers you might expect to find anywhere else on the planet – they simply exist on top of ice sheets instead of land, transporting melted ice and snow, rather than rainwater, from one location to another. The margins around Antarctica experience surface melting today . ""We've seen that following intense melt episodes, the ice melt can pond in crevasses and form lakes that destabilize ice shelves in a process scientists call 'hydrofracture.'"	1
Obama spoke today about the new climate plan. The United States is committed to cutting its carbon footprint. This is vital if there’s to be a chance of turning the current 83-page outline of a new worldwide climate agreement into something acceptable to the world’s variegated nations at Paris climate talks in December.	1
Their model shows hurricane frequency rising dramatically as the planet warms over the coming decades. Hurricane surges are more likely caused by global warming. Which means we may need to get ready for storms like Katrina — which caused [PDF] over 1,800 deaths and over $100 billion in damage — to become regular events.	0
“During this very active year for our Wildlife Rescue and Recovery program, this gift comes at a particularly important time for us,” said Tom Schmid, president and chief executive officer of the Texas State Aquarium, a $40,000 beneficiary. The planet’s remaining fossil fuels must be kept in the ground. But the boom in plastics production relies on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of oil or natural gas from deep in the earth.	1

Professor Bala at first assumed that this was a uniquely Indian problem, until he read an article in Nature which questioned why there was a shortage of upcoming climate scientists worldwide. I was surprised to learn that shortage of good climate scientists is a global problem. Indeed, Nature was reporting on a group of climate scientists at the Laboratory of Dynamic Meteorology in Paris who had recently published summaries of some of the field’s foremost challenges as a way of driving up interest in the subject.	1
And Pachauri should have been more careful about drumming up business for his organization. That global warming constitutes a fraud is a hoot. As Pachauri told me when I interviewed him in December 2008: “Thousands of people are part of what some of these people say is a conspiracy?	0
Humans are exacerbating global climate change. The question is, what?	0
But that doesn’t mean the problem is solved,” says Tracey Holloway, an atmospheric scientist at the Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. On a global basis, Professor Holloway notes, 1 in 8 deaths each year are caused by air pollution. Like Nolen, Holloway thinks it’s time to start decoupling the discussion of pollution from that of climate change.	1
Even so, we should be thankful for small mercies. Not often a scientist is prepared to call bull on the way the left-wing press routinely hypes up global warming scares. Albert has done the world of science a favour.	2
“Certainly global warming has contributed to the rate at which the ground has dried out because of the warm temperatures,” Dr. Nielsen-Gammon said. The magnitude of the dryness is well beyond what global warming would be able to do so far. To ignore the notion of climate change would be irresponsible, Mr. Perry said, but he added, “To say it’s 100 percent of that is irresponsible as well.” In his view, reducing carbon dioxide emissions seems like the right thing to do for the long term, taking into account future generations.	2
I discuss the Retro Report piece and nuclear winter on The Takeaway. A nuclear war could plunge the world into a deadly ice age. Three decades later, does this theory still resonate?	1
And in many cases, those risks are being exacerbated by a changing climate.” While detailed studies and analyses about the role climate change may have played in Harvey's severity will take time to complete, most scientists say they are confident about at least a few factors. Among the clearest: Sea surface temperatures are higher. In addition, warmer subsurface water in the oceans means that storms can last longer than they might otherwise, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist in the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colo. Research he and others have done leads him to expect that climate change may actually lead to fewer hurricanes, but ones that are more intense and longer-lasting.	1
And when the price tag rises for action on climate change, he adds, “those costs will eventually be seen and will affect the politics.” That doesn’t mean support for greening the energy system is about to crumble in states like California and New York. Global warming is caused mostly by human carbon emissions. “I’m optimistic ... we’ll find affordable ways to get this done,” Dr. Cullenward says of the energy transition.	0
Ballot initiative 1631, which proposed charging companies for their carbon pollution, failed after earning roughly 43% of the early voting count, too big a deficit to overcome with absentee ballots. We must address global warming by weaning our state off of fossil fuels. Economists have long proposed a carbon tax as a solution to the climate crisis.	0
With growing populations and changing climates, fresh water is becoming increasingly valuable, says Edward Osann, a senior policy analyst and water efficiency project director at the National Resources Defense Council. We are seeing more extremes: more substantial droughts, followed by substantial floods. “If we can sustain ourselves while using less fresh water, we will be more resilient while going into these fluctuations in the hydrologic cycle of the future.” The US population grew by 4 percent between 2010 and 2015, or 12 million people, but total withdrawals for public supply – water that comes out of kitchen faucets and lawn sprinklers – decreased by 7 percent.	0
"Malina Pettibone, a Guerneville native, dances with an American flag while listening to Nelly Furtado as the Russian River waters rise. Because of a warming climate, we could see more of these wetter atmospheric events that drench the ground, sparking floods and mudslides.

The world's biosphere is now adding to global warming, turning traditional assumptions about greenhouse gases on their heads, according to a new study published Thursday in the scientific journal Nature. Plants absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, as part of photosynthesis. But a team of researchers looking closer at this assumption have found that human-induced changes to plants and animal populations have transformed the biosphere's status from a net greenhouse gas sink to a net greenhouse gas source.	1

In August, BBC Radio 4 invited Lord Lawson – the former chancellor of the exchequer, now the chair of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a think tank that rejects mainstream climate science – on to the Today programme. Global temperatures had not risen in the past decade. This went unchallenged by the interviewer, and the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, has now launched an investigation into Lawson's appearance.	1

It is one the world’s lowest lying nations, leading to fears it will be swamped by rising sea levels in climate change doomsayers are proved right. Sea levels have not risen by as much as previously predicted. Oceanographer William P de Lange and marine geologist Bob Carter said there was little evidence to support claims, such as those by Al Gore, that the sea would rise by 20 feet by the end of the century.	2
Among the sources adding methane to the atmosphere are leaking gas pipelines, coal mines, cattle and sheep, and animal wastes. Methane can be much easier and less expensive to contain than carbon dioxide emissions. Since 2004, the United States has been part of something known as the Methane to Markets Partnership, a 38-country agreement to reduce methane emissions worldwide through cost-effective technologies.	1
Muddy salt marshes get a bum rap. Coastlines around the world hold enormous ecological value, both as habitats for species that can live nowhere else and as a buffer for surging seas during storm events. And, like the rainforests and reefs, salt marsh ecosystems are in trouble.	1
There are a total of 18 tweets in his thread, which I’d encourage everyone to read in full. Climate change may or may not bear responsibility for the flood on last night. Fact: Climate change is producing heavier rainfalls worldwide.” One need not be a master logician to see that climate change can produce heavier rains without bearing responsibility for all floods.	1
Otherwise, there isn’t much benefit to bringing up a heavily politicized point of debate. Bringing up climate change derails discussions of community-based solutions for problems like flooding and the resulting problems of transportation and public health. Retired Lieutenant General Russel Honoré, who is often credited for turning around Hurricane Katrina relief efforts, has for the last twelve years been organizing around environmental issues in small communities of color in his home state.	2
International officials have reconvened in hopes of amending the Montreal Protocol to include HFC limits. A global reduction in HFCs could prevent 0.5 degrees Celsius in warming over the next century. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s a moderate step in suppressing climate change.	1
We’ve already won the battle over public opinion. Fewer than half of Americans believe human activity is responsible for most global warming. Voters rank “stopping global warming” dead last when asked to rank problems they want government to address.	1
But the panel's latest report will likely face extra scrutiny after the previous one included an error that exaggerated the rate of melting glaciers in the Himalayas. As a result of our past, present, and expected future emissions of carbon dioxide, we are committed to climate change and effects will persist for many centuries even if emissions of carbon dioxide stop. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon echoed the sentiment.	0
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will vote today on a bill promoting carbon trading, which sets greenhouse gas emissions limits and allowances for each industry and then creates a system to trade the allowances. Carbon trading actually delays the crucial process of big polluters reducing their emissions. We host a debate between Annie Petsonk of Environmental Defense and Daphne Wysham of the Institute for Policy Studies.	1
A group called Californians for Population Stabilization claims “population growth [is] wildly out of control” and is causing “further degradation of America’s natural treasures.” A 2008 report from the Australian government says that babies are hurting the nation’s economy. A study recently that concludes children are detrimental to the environment because they contribute to global warming. The study suggests that couples should have at least one less child than they were planning on having.	1
They say that the government is spending billions of dollars a year in climate change research and mitigation efforts. The United States ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and participates actively in global climate diplomacy. They even note that in 2009 the House passed a sweeping cap and trade bill to control greenhouse gas emissions – legislation that all three of them vigorously opposed.	1
The rest of the land is simply gone, claimed by the sea. The global sea level rise is caused by two main factors: water expanding as it warms, and large-scale melting of glaciers and polar ice caps. Modeling from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that it would rise at an accelerated rate this century.	1
It has even enacted a few measures to prevent bycatch, most of them species-specific. But a global threat warrants a global response. It’s still unclear what that response might look like, but internal scientific expertise may position the IWC to lead it.	0
This small thickening, sustained over thousands of years and spread over the vast expanse of these sectors of Antarctica, corresponds to a very large gain of ice – enough to outweigh the losses from fast-flowing glaciers in other parts of the continent and reduce global sea level rise. Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away. “But this is also bad news.	1
"""My research has assessed how surface melting may change in the future under various climate scenarios,"" he adds.

Even if climate change was happening, Abbott said, he argued it could be a benefit. Then there’s the evidence that higher concentrations of carbon dioxide (which is a plant food after all) are actually greening the planet and helping to lift agricultural yields. He blamed ministers in his own government for not being able to go as far as he would have liked in reducing the renewable energy target when he was prime minister, and he blamed the Turnbull government not campaigning on energy prices for costing the party seats at the 2016 election.	2

should consider new information, including recently publicized e-mail messages from a British climate research institute. The e-mail messages showed scientists using faulty data to support the notion of manmade global warming. He also referenced the work of the International Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations body charged with assessing climate research, which has come under criticism from climate change skeptics for what they say has been sloppy science and, in some instances, conflicts of interest among panel members.	2
"This in turn will lead to a 70 percent increase in demand for food, putting more pressure on water through farming, which is already the biggest consumer of water. As climate change contributes to rising sea levels and extreme weather, at least one in four people will live in a country with chronic or recurring shortages of fresh water by 2050. Connor said funding for projects was still often based on ""investment in pumps and pipes"" rather than a more holistic view, taking into account water's key role in building a sustainable economy as part of the new global development goals."	0
And projecting this positive externality forward in time reveals that, rather than leading to “fields that no longer grow,” it will likely bestow an additional $9.8 trillion in crop production benefits between now and 2050. All that our world leaders need is a little more common sense, in order to avoid the nonsense of seeking a globally-binding treaty to reduce CO2 emissions. Indeed, it is high time for them, and for all of us, to recognize and embrace the truth.	2
Nearly 100,000 people eat at the temple daily, Singh says, and “that food now is being grown organically.” Moreover, “we need to realize that we, the people of the United States and other developed countries, are contributing significantly in warming the planet.

Here’s the opening section: Global temperatures are running far above last year’s record-setting level, all but guaranteeing that 2015 will be the hottest year in the historical record — and undermining political claims that global warming had somehow stopped. Last month had been the hottest September on record, and in fact took the biggest leap above the previous September that any month has displayed since 1880, when tracking began at a global scale. The agency also announced that the January-to-September period had been the hottest such span on the books.	1
The video below shows smaller icebergs that were recently calved from a glacier in Iceland.

Some say that concerns about Arctic oil leading to increased global warming are overblown because the stuff will be so expensive to drill.

Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have both mocked the idea of human-caused climate change, with Trump suggesting that it is a hoax invented by China to harm the American economy (he now says that last point was a joke). Brussels survived this week’s terrorist attacks, but it may not survive climate change (much of the city is less than 100 feet above sea level). Doesn’t it seem prudent to invest in efforts to avert not only shoe bombers but also the drowning of the world’s low-lying countries?	0
His colleague Jack Kaye, associate director of NASA’s Earth Science Division added “NASA science provides an important knowledge base that the centres and their surrounding communities can use in preparing for changing climate conditions.” Yet Anthony Watts, writing on his blog site Watts Up With That, points out that “one of the biggest space disasters ever, the Challenger disaster, was caused by FREEZING COLD WEATHER and idiotic management that ignored risks related to cold weather as warned by engineers.” “I have a pretty hard time believing that about a degree of warming is going to cause all these woes. There has been no increase in global temperature for 18 years. As for the sea level rises which NASA considers such a pressing threat to its assets, the verdict of Swedish geologist and physicist Nils-Axel Mörner, a former chairman of the INQUA International Commission on Sea Level Change who has studied global sea levels for 35 years is: “the sea is not rising”.	2
In April, the president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, told the Guardian that it was crazy that governments were still driving the use of coal, oil and gas by providing subsidies. We need to get rid of fossil fuel subsidies now. Barack Obama and the G20 nations called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies in 2009, but little progress had been made until oil prices fell in 2014.	1
The Navy, Army, and Air Force have all invested increasingly in solar and other renewables in a bid to make the military more efficient, economical, and resilient. There is a coming transition from fossil fuels to renewables, but are reluctant to speak about it because it’s tied to climate change. The national security argument helps pave the way for “a sensible, well-reasoned conversation about advanced energy,” he says.	1
But defenders of climate change hysteria were looking for loopholes. It’s important to keep in mind that there are natural short-term variations in global temperature that happen right alongside human-induced warming. For instance, it would have been impossible for the IPCC to predict if a volcanic eruption might temporarily cool the Earth, as the Mount Pinatubo eruption did in 1991.	1
But they can make choices that reduce their impacts on the land, water, air, and other living things. Global Warming is a theory and should be taught as such in our schools. We are also very concerned that Evolution will be taught as fact, when in reality, it too, is only a theory.” “The standards should teach facts as facts and theories as theories, allowing students to form their own opinions in a healthy, non-partisan way,” Reeder said.	2
The bigger problem with the Trump administration's US team at the talks is that “they are disengaged,” he said, and failed to offer political muscle to help move the talks forward when COP24 discussions hit road bumps. The challenge moving forward will be getting countries to more deeply cut their carbon pollution. “I think there’s going to be a reckoning next year,” Samantha Gross, a fellow in the Cross-Brookings Initiative on Energy and Climate, told BuzzFeed News.	0
As climate change nudges temperatures slowly upwards, it unleashes a vicious cycle of melting and absorbing, melting and absorbing in the arctic. It's a bit of a chicken-egg thing: we have less ice because it’s warm, but it’s really warm, so we have less ice. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.	1
Climate deniers can still call global warming a hoax when looking at hotter temperatures, dying forests and increasing wildfires. Millions of burning acres are a little more obvious to most than calving glaciers or seas rising by centimeters.	0
"Everyone agrees that ""something is very, very wrong with the Arctic climate,"" as Mashable's science editor tweeted on Wednesday. The meltdown results from the complex interaction of players including emissions-driven climate change, warm air and water, and shrinking ice area. Divvying up blame is tough, but the general trends are clear."	1
Can you talk about what’s happening in China, as you teach there? China passed the United States in 2007 as the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas that is most responsible for the disruption of global climate.	1
"Cox and Al-Khalili, among others, argue that climate scientists are near-unanimous in agreeing that the world is warming, that humans are causing it, and that it is dangerous. Somewhere between 90% and 100% of active climate scientists agree that global warming is real and human-caused. So having someone who disagrees with this consensus position, the argument goes, isn't providing ""balance"" or being ""impartial"" – it's giving a fringe position undue prominence and suggesting that there is a scientific controversy where none exists."	0
"Malcolm Turnbull got a double espresso... and completely dropped it ""You'd have to ask Josh Frydenberg,"" Turnbull said. We will not be imposing a carbon tax and we will not be imposing an emissions trading scheme. Twenty minutes later Frydenberg was asked why he put an emissions intensity scheme on the table on Monday morning."	1
“Science can be controversial in a country where evangelical Christians make up a quarter of the adult population. Global warming is caused due to human activity, and only 44 percent believe it to be a “very serious problem” versus 90 percent of Brazilians, 68 percent of the French and 65 percent of the Japanese population. The result?	0
Last month, a major new climate commitment came out of the United States: a pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. Is increasingly necessary if the world wants to avoid the most severe repercussions of global warming. And it involved a major economy – the world’s fifth largest – but not the federal government.	0
According to Priscilla Villa, the South Texas organizer for Earthworks, “Plastics shows how issues go beyond silos and intersect.” She says lower-carbon fracked gas was first touted as a “bridge fuel” to help shift reliance from coal-fired power plants to renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Fracking wells leak massive quantities of methane gas, which is eighty-six times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over a twenty-year span. A Texas Commission on Environmental Quality agent responding to complaints became ill after using an infrared camera to document emissions otherwise invisible to the human eye.	1
“This Green New Deal is nothing more than a radical far-left proposal that has no basis in reality,” Sen. James Inhofe, a prominent climate denier who once brought a snowball onto the Senate floor to mock global warming, told BuzzFeed News by email. You can’t run the machine called America without fossil fuels and nuclear energy or the millions of jobs this deal seeks to eliminate. The Green New Deal is being “defined by the most outlandish parts of it,” Gorman said.	1
ET The Oroville Dam's overflow channel failed in 2017. Major dams in California are five times more likely to flood this century than the last one due to global warming. That means Californians can expect more disasters like the Oroville Dam, whose overflow channel failed in 2017 after days of flooding had filled state reservoirs to 85% of their capacity, leading to the evacuation of more than 180,000 people and losses of around $300 million.	0
Well, talk about what you are seeing as the connections right now? Global warming does not make more hurricanes. And that’s because hurricanes take their energy from the temperature of surface waters.	2
Still, many say that instating monetary incentives, such as a global carbon tax or bottom price for carbon emissions, is the only effective way to ensure that countries reduce their emissions enough to avoid irreversible damage to the environment. A global price on carbon is politically and economically unlikely, but individual nations have already implemented and may continue to implement such systems to meet their climate goals. Despite the uncertainties, officials say that progress is being made behind the scenes as trust develops between the delegations and differing positions begin to solidify.	1
“[E]verything depends upon how it’s structured and where the money goes,” says Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen, a nonprofit, consumer-advocacy group. Increased revenue from a carbon tax can be used to alleviate other tax burdens. With some simple financial reshuffling, a carbon tax can be completely revenue neutral and can even spur growth.	1
”If they persist, there will be war.” The CO2 balloon bursts (March 14, 2001, by Douglas Jehl with my help) Under strong pressure from conservative Republicans and industry groups, President Bush reversed a campaign pledge today and said his administration would not seek to regulate power plants’ emissions of carbon dioxide, a gas that many scientists say is a key contributor to global warming…. The White House had received ”a lot of communications” from those critical of any attempt to regulate emissions that are viewed as contributing to global warming. ”Fortunately, the president responded quickly,” Mr. Kelly said.	1
Pruitt has denied the veracity of climate change, co-authoring an article for the National Review that stated “the debate is far from settled. Global warming is occurring thanks to human activity. “Pruitt, is known as an Oklahoma fossil-fuel advocate and an attorney general who has fought environmental regulations.	0
And so, you build one plant at a time, using the most up-to-date technology you need, and then it’s amazing, in another twelve months, before your demand increases for electricity, you build another plant with better technology. China has already overtaken the United States when it comes to being the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide. Can you talk about what’s happening in China, as you teach there?	1
Also, Texas public schools use the popular online learning tool BrainPOP “which isn’t just pro-climate change, it’s pro-man-made climate change,” a Texas teacher, who asked to remain anonymous, told Breitbart Texas. There is a connection between human activity and an assumptive change in global climate. It has been almost a decade since Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth promoted the notion of global warming later rebranded as climate change.	0
A common charge against environmentalists is that they’re hypocrites. They tell us to reduce our carbon emissions. They condemn Big Macs, yet they buy raspberries imported from a different hemisphere.	1
At one point, yelling over the engine roar, Dr. Running shut me up with a simple observation: “Look how much is left!” His point was that the situation is not hopeless, and I came to see that he was right. The forests of the world are continuing to take up a large amount of carbon. Even given all the problems we are seeing in the American West and in other affected regions, the healthy forests still outnumber the sick ones.	1
The IPCC report was created to outline the difference between a 1.5-degree Celsius and a 2-degree Celsius rise in global surface temperatures. If global temperatures are allowed to rise to 2 degrees Celsius, “virtually all” coral reefs will be lost. Peterson is particularly concerned about funding priorities in light of a federal government decision to give a small nine-person organisation nearly half a billion dollars in funding earlier this year.	0
Similarly, a Yale and George Mason University partnership has suggested that telling people that “97% of climate scientists have concluded that human-caused climate change is happening” can help change minds — another argument for the power of authority. The reality of sea level rise forced everyone to come up with a plan, including trusted local business leaders and Republican politicians. Though they differ on the details, the one thing all of these experts agree on is that just telling folks the facts — temperatures are going up, seas are acidifying, and the most likely reason is people burning fossil fuels — doesn’t move the needle on climate opinion.	0
Others said it demonstrates the challenges of trying to assess the state of ice sheets on such a huge land mass, where time scales and environmental factors often differ marketedly. Snow accumulation has dramatically increased on West Antarctica’s coastal ice sheet in the 20th century. But one of the study&apos;s authors, Elizabeth Thomas, a paleoclimatologist with the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, said many of the same factors leading to increased snowfall also have been found to be responsible for the thinning of the ice shelves.	1
by Kathleen Rest February 7, 2007 10:27 PM U.S. behind curve on global warming February 7, 2007 Two recent reports on climate change put the U.S. position on global warming in stark relief. Human activity is the main cause of global warming, while the other investigation reveals widespread political interference in federal climate science here in the United States. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) solidifies the scientific understanding that the increasing amounts of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere are man-made.	0
The commission reviewers determined the visual impact of the Ivanpah power plant could not be reduced but recommended that the commission’s board license the project because of “overriding considerations.” “It will provide critical environmental benefits by helping the state reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and these positive attributes must be weighed against the project’s adverse impacts,” Terry O’Brien, a deputy director at the energy commission, wrote in a memorandum filed Wednesday. It is because of these benefits and the concerns regarding the adverse impacts that global warming will have upon the state and our environment, including desert ecosystems. “Staff’s position on the I.S.E.G.S.	0
The global population of polar bears, estimated at 26,000, will decline by 30 percent over the next 35 years due to melting Arctic ice. The study, which was published in the Royal Society Biology Letters, was lead by biologist Eric Regehr, whose team determined that there is a 70 percent chance this significant decline will occur by 2050.	0
Alaska&apos;s glacial ice loss now comes from thinning, not from icebergs calving at the front of the glacier. Most of their potential for catastrophic ice mass loss has already run its course. Operation IceBridge is in its sixth year of monitoring changes in polar ice.	1
Christy, in particular, has repeatedly said groups associated with the IPCC suppress findings that contradict mainstream views about the impact of human activity on climate change. Climate change is, beyond a reasonable doubt, the result of humans releasing fossil fuels and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Ninety-seven percent of climatologists, earth scientists, and meteorologists say they believe humans are contributing to climate change, an assertion Politifact has said is “mostly true.” Of the 70,000 peer-reviewed articles on global warming published in 2013 and 2014, only four authors rejected the idea that human activity is the main force driving climate change.	0
If the documents we have seen so far are representative, it appears that the White House installed a former oil industry lobbyist as the chief of staff for the Council on Environmental Quality and then systematically sought to prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from reporting on dangers to health, the environment and the economy. There may have been an orchestrated effort to mislead the public about the threat of global climate change. These are serious allegations, and they are ones that we’ll be exploring in detail in this hearing and in our ongoing investigation.	2
But just like those temperatures, which have set heat records in the last three years, Bridenstine’s views have evidently changed. Carbon dioxide is in fact a greenhouse gas. “All that is very real and happening.” The questions irked Republican senators, such as Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, who are unwilling to accept the scientific evidence that people are causing climate change.	1
(All you need to do is check out a fire map to get a sense of the scale. The global warming hoax is a plot to increase government control and spending. Seems like doing something about global warming might not be so expensive after all.	2
Its member organizations established a training program to teach manufacturing workers to use less energy and reduce waste, and its Industrial Energy Efficiency initiative has saved manufacturers millions of dollars through energy conservation. A real investment in getting off the fossil fuel addiction is far more likely to produce long-term, high-paying jobs than building the Keystone XL pipeline. But that, ultimately, is beside the point.	1
As a kicker, here’s some of what one former employee, Ed Garvey, says in a videotaped interview about the company’s climate research around 1980, and what he sees as a lost opportunity: It saw that this is an opportunity to lead in the science and the discussion. Had Exxon continued in that role, there might not be such a cacophony of anti-climate arguments that are ongoing now because there would have been somebody at the table who came from the side of fossil fuel use and would have been shown to be a leader in terms of the science. That just didn’t happen, but I really think that was their intention when I was working there.	1
In a 2015 paper produced for the Global Warming Policy Foundation, Indur Goklany, a science and technology policy analyst who has previously represented the United States on the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere “is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally”. Carbon dioxide fertilizes plants, and emissions from fossil fuels have already had a hugely beneficial effect on crops, increasing yields by at least 10-15 percent. “This has not only been good for humankind but for the natural world too, because an acre of land that is not used for crops is an acre of land that is left for nature,” Golkany said.	2
“While Louisiana was flooding, there were also huge flood events under way in Moscow (biggest rains in 129 years of record-keeping), the Sudan, Manila, and probably plenty of other places,” climate activist Bill McKibben told the Seattle Times. The global south in particular is both more vulnerable to the effects of climate change and less equipped to deal with those effects. “There’s definitely an increase in heavy rainfall due to climate change,” John Nielsen-Gammon, the state climatologist in Texas, told The New York Times.	0
The company has converted its refrigerator factory in Decatur, Ala., for use of the new blowing agent. The effect will be to eliminate emissions that are equivalent to 400,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide a year, about the same global warming impact as 78,000 cars. The company has also applied to the Environmental Protection Agency for permission to use a refrigerant with less global warming potential.	1
But he went on to say that renewable energy was not needed because climate change was nonsense. Global temperature had dropped in the last 10 years. Richard Black, the director of the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, recorded on Twitter a series of false or dubious statements Lawson made during the interview.	2
His testimony also took a more mainstream stance on climate science, diverging from his past. Global temperatures had stopped rising. But just like those temperatures, which have set heat records in the last three years, Bridenstine’s views have evidently changed.	2
"""However, if governments force the public to bear the external costs and even subsidize fossil fuels, carbon emissions are likely to continue to grow, with deleterious consequences for young people and future generations."" Humanity will not alter its energy course as consequences of burning all fossil fuels become clearer. ""Yet strong evidence about the dangers of human-made climate change have so far had little effect."	1
Now, they are getting into the carbon trading market. This is a clear conflict of interest for a financial institution to both profit from financing fossil fuels and profit from carbon trading. They’re actually charging somewhere on the order of 13 percent commission on all carbon trading transactions.	1
(BuzzFeed News is not a member of the group.) NOAA researchers had used misleading data to exaggerate global warming, and failed to archive it so it couldn’t be verified. This flawed study, according to the Mail on Sunday, then “duped” world leaders into spending billions on climate action.	2
"""We go through the hard science, yes, but we actually use the climate activists' and the global warming establishment's own arguments to have a lot of fun with,"" Morano tells OneNewsNow. Global warming causes more prostitution, barroom brawls, airline turbulence. But contrary to Morano's claims, climate change is not just a conspiracy created by scientists and politicians."	0
This year looks poised to see a slight drop in emissions, even as the world economy is projected to grow more than 3%. Gor the first time, carbon dioxide emissions have stabilized, at least temporarily, while global gross domestic product grew robustly. “It's a bit of good news.” The report, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, looked at carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas since 1990.	1
In fact, Venus is 25.72 million miles closer to the Sun than the Earth is. The idea that carbon emissions could turn Earth into Venus is not just laughable. Venus has a much different atmosphere, and is millions of miles closer to the Sun.	2
Now, 40 years might sound like it’s a long way off, but it isn’t really, you know. Just to drive home to people what that means, it means that in 40 years from now we can’t be driving cars that are fueled with fossil fuels, with oil. We can’t be generating our electricity by burning coal and natural gas.	0
Other polls find a similar divide. Most scientists agree on whether global warming is happening. Among Republicans, nearly 6 in 10 say it is not a serious problem, fewer than one-quarter support increased government action, and two-thirds think there is “a lot of disagreement” among scientists.	1
The vast, scrabbly sheath of sea ice drifting on the Arctic Ocean ended its annual summer retreat this week, and the result was sobering. This year tied with 2007 as having the second smallest ice extent ever recorded. Of course the satellite record only goes back to 1979, seemingly leaving ample room for debate.	1
That same year, the World Wildlife Foundation study entitled “Norwegian Consumption, Chinese pollution“ found Norway’s appetite for imports is increasing pollution in developing nations – a predicament that is certainly not limited to the Scandinavian nation. Carbon footprint calculations do not take into account the emissions produced by goods that are imported into countries. The current proposal, by Climate Minister Helgesen’s summation, is missing some crucial details about how the nation will proceed to reach its goals.	1
The Swedish government recently adopted another Green Party idea: a vehicle tax based on carbon dioxide emissions rather than weight. Some cars (such as hybrids) are heavy, but relatively low in fossil-fuel emissions. This is the latest wrinkle in a sixteen-year-old Swedish movement toward carbon-based taxation.	1
Earlier this month, he warned that Manhattan would be “underwater” unless action was taken soon on climate change. Some portions of Manhattan could experience flooding, but not the entire island, even under the most catastrophic models. Obama also touted his administration’s record in expanding public lands and taking regulatory actions, including enforcing the Endangered Species Act (which many Californians blame for overzealous protection of the Delta smelt at the expense of water allocations to farmers).	1
Two years ago, in 2015, this moral framing of climate change had not yet resonated with most Americans, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. In the spring of that year, 10 percent of Americans viewed global warming as a religious issue. But if this reframing does take hold, it could have a widespread impact, according to the study’s authors.	1
"Such proposals would ""level the playing field for coal,"" allowing it to better compete with natural gas and renewable energies, said coal analyst Andy Roberts with the firm Wood Mackenzie. Pressure to reduce carbon dioxide emissions will continue. ""It can't just be, 'We're going to get rid of these regulations, and you guys can party until the next administration comes,' "" Cloud Peak Energy Vice President Richard Reavey said."	1
We’ve already won the battle over public opinion. Human activity is responsible for most global warming. Voters rank “stopping global warming” dead last when asked to rank problems they want government to address.	0
“An iceberg four times the size of Manhattan has broken off Greenland, creating plenty of room for global warming deniers to start their own country,” Mr. Markey said in a statement. Arctic ice is a canary in a coal mine that provides clear warnings on climate. And according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2010 is on its way to becoming the hottest year in the modern instrument record.	0
Her group is led largely by young women of color, which she said should come as no surprise, because people who are already vulnerable are going to be disproportionately hit by climate change. Women are more likely to be harmed in the kinds of natural disasters made more likely by global warming, bear greater responsibility for getting access to water, energy, and other basics of domestic life, and often are shut out of opportunities when resources decline. “If you’re a victim of a system of oppression, you’re more affected by the climate crisis — that goes for women,” she said.	0
A new study, published Monday in Nature Geoscience, suggests that the explanation of the phenomenon lies not in the Southern Ocean itself, but in the Pacific. The expansion in Antarctic ice began to accelerate around the turn of the 21st century. At approximately the same time, the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), a prolonged fluctuation in atmospheric pressure that affects sea temperatures, shifted into a negative phase, cooling the ocean surface in the tropical Pacific, with global ramifications.	1
“Everyone is talking about climate change now. Unfortunately, what is happening now in our central regions is evidence of this global climate change, because we have never in our history faced such weather conditions in the past. “This means that we need to change the way we work, change the methods that we used in the past.” [Kremlin] Russia halts grain exports as drought, heat and fire devastate crops.	0
"It's putting intense pressure on 2 C.,"" Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of New South Wales in Australia, told The Guardian. Global warming could eventually reach these levels. ""The interesting thing is the scale at which we're breaking records."	0
They contend that it could be possible, but would require a very fast, rapid decline in global emissions. For 1.5 degrees, carbon emissions must reach zero by 2050. If the planet warms to 2 degrees Celsius, many small island nations that are either currently at or slightly below sea level, such as Malaysia, would be under greater threat from rising oceans.	1
The IPCC’s report also states that climate change is forcing terrestrial, freshwater and marine species to shift their geographical ranges and migration patterns. The scientific community is under tremendous financial and peer pressure to reach the conclusion that global industry is damaging the environment. “Ethical standards have been lowered, peer review has been corrupted, and we can’t trust peers in our most prestigious journals anymore,” Joe Bast, President and CEO of Heartland Institute, told Fox News.	1
He is among those concerned that the pursuit of energy miracles, if seen as the only path, might weaken support for other efforts. Radical innovation in low-carbon energy technology is critical to long term climate mitigation. But he said he and others are exploring the creation of an investors’ coalition, “complementary to the Gates initiative,” aimed at overcoming a different set of barriers to progress.	0
"The IPCC report states that in order to keep global temperatures below the Paris Climate Agreement cap, the world must achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Earlier this year painted a bleaker portrait than the IPCC, stating that without a ""decisive shift"" by 2030 the globe will pass the point of no return and be unable to keep the global temperature rise to below 2C. While three-quarters of Australians are concerned about global warming, the emotional toll can be greatest for those who work in environmental research and activism."	0
"""The cave is in a condition that we would normally not see until at least September – large, inviting and collapsing."" The ice is prone to collapse because of warmer weather. On Sunday, another section of the Big Four Ice Caves collapsed and was captured on video."	0
“We listen to the people who actually give us legs.” The piece in question was the debut by his resident climate expert, Roger Pielke, Jr., arguing that there was no evidence to support claims by alarmists that “extreme weather events” are on the increase and doing more damage than ever before. Mankind is contributing to global warming but is not yet convinced that this contribution will be catastrophic. But neither his scientific bona fides (he was Director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado Boulder) nor his measured, fact-based delivery were enough to satisfy the ravening green-lust of FiveThirtyEight’s mainly liberal readership.	1
Titley, from Penn State, agrees. There is no evidence I’ve seen from any climate scientist that says hurricanes are going to get weaker, or seas will come down, or air is going to get drier. “And a lesson from the past eight weeks is, we are not ready for today’s weather, let alone tomorrow’s weather.” Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.	2
"As the soil gradually melts, these buried organisms will decay and release the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, which can, in turn, lead to even more warming. It would take decades of warming to melt permafrost buried beneath the active layer of soil that freezes and thaws with the seasons. ""The conclusions that permafrost-carbon modelers were reaching was that, until you thaw really deep, we&apos;re not going to get this large, old carbon signal and that the really deep thaw of carbon on land is not going to happen until beyond 2100,"" study leader Katey Walter Anthony, an ecologist and biogeochemist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Live Science."	1
Robots will also be used regularly for warfare in that time frame. The seas will rise by a few inches by 2100, but that prediction is as ridiculous as a 1910 prediction that the world would be covered by horse droppings by 2000. Technology is moving too quickly for any such prediction to be relevant.	2
“I guess I see it as a way for them to distract from having to deal with the reality of climate change,” McKibben told BuzzFeed News by email. This summer is seeing record lows for Arctic ice. I guess I get why they'd want to change the subject.” Whether Core News represents a new evolution in opposition research, or is simply political operatives seeking to package research they couldn’t unload in any other way is tough to tell, said Nick Surgey of PR Watch.	1
Scientific analysis pointing to a human role in warming the climate through burning fossil fuels. Check out his 1938 paper on the subject: “The Artificial Production of Carbon Dioxide and Its Influence on Temperature.” By 1956, The New York Times was writing on combustion-driven global warming.	1
Each frame shows precipitation over a five-year period. Carbon dioxide emissions will remain on their current upward trajectory, leveling out only toward the end of the century. This is a scenario that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls RCP8.5.	1
In fact, there is plenty of evidence that ordinary Americans, subjected to increasingly bizarre and devastating weather events, care about addressing the issue of climate change. A majority of Americans feel that global climate change is either extremely or very important. The survey also reveals that 75 percent of Democratic voters believe that climate change is an issue that they care deeply about.	1
"""To suggest that we had reached definitive conclusions, decades before the world’s experts and while climate science was in an early stage of development, is not credible,"" he said. Through the 1980s, Exxon researched the emerging science of man-made climate change by, among other things, modeling increases in global temperatures due to carbon dioxide emissions. Over the next decade, the company quietly took that understanding of higher global temperatures into account when building pipelines over thawing permafrost and offshore platforms over rising seas."	1
I’m looking for more recent data, but in 2010 researchers at Yale and George Mason University came to this conclusion after a climate survey: [T]he conventional wisdom holds that young Americans, growing up in a world of ever more certain scientific evidence, increasing news attention, alarming entertainment portrayals, and school-based curricula, should be more engaged with and concerned about the issue of climate change than older Americans. Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 are, for the most part, split on the issue of global warming and, on some indicators, relatively disengaged when compared to older generations. Will this change?	1
This was the sixth smallest November extent since records began in 1979, according to analysis by the National Snow and Ice Data Center using data from NOAA and NASA. It is cold and dark in the Arctic so it will revert to its colder temperatures. “But every warm air moving into the Arctic keeps it from getting really cold like it used to.	1
And I think it’s very important to understand again that we have a really short time for action. We now have 380 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Traditionally that number was 280.	1
Here’s a look at some of the efforts under way to stem the risks. Around 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by deforestation from agricultural expansion and destructive logging practices, among other factors. In response, the international community is working to help strengthen rule of law and crack down on the nefarious practices that lead to deforestation in countries around the world.	1
The truth is muddier. A broad swath of both Democrats and Republicans supports efforts to bolster clean energy and to limit carbon emissions from power plants. Data also suggest Americans support oil exports, nuclear energy, and, to a lesser degree, hydraulic fracturing.	1
In 2012, the Wall Street Journal printed an open letter from 16 respected scientists who disputed global warming. Perhaps the most inconvenient fact is the lack of global warming for well over 10 years now. This is known to the warming establishment, as one can see from the 2009 ‘Climategate’ email of climate scientist Kevin Trenberth, who wrote that ‘The fact is that we can’t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty that we can’t.	2
“Right now countries write [INDCs] to make themselves look good.” Using the threat of sanctions to ensure countries meet their commitments, however, is largely off the table, since most negotiators agree that countries would be hesitant to sign off on an agreement that includes punitive measures. The current commitments are insufficient to limit global warming to 2 degrees C. It helps explain why the draft accord stipulates that nations should reevaluate their greenhouse gas limits every 5 years, a provision that environmentalists pushed for during a negotiating session in Bonn in early September.	0
Oceanographer William P de Lange and marine geologist Bob Carter said there was little evidence to support claims, such as those by Al Gore, that the sea would rise by 20 feet by the end of the century. No justification exists for continuing to base sea-level policy and coastal management regulation upon the outcomes of deterministic or semi-empirical sea-level modelling. “Such modelling remains speculative rather than predictive.	1
President Obama is earning criticism for Earth Day plans that include taking Air Force One to the Everglades in Florida to serve as a backdrop for his latest speech about his fears of global warming. Global warming is damaging tourism and people’s health. The President has also said that climate change is a national security risk.	0
Those policies are the US contribution toward the Paris talks, and will be combined with the rest of the world’s pledges to reach a final deal come December. That’s what we’re going to use to push other countries to join in global climate action. To bolster the case for addressing climate change, the US Environmental Protection Agency rolled out a report Monday touting the public health and economic benefits of reducing greenhouse emissions.	0
So there’s a huge mismatch in terms of the financial issues that — the financial outlays in terms of fighting this battle for reality, basically, and for the public perception. We have about a ten-year window to make very, very deep cuts in our carbon fuel use. He speaks normally in very conservative and measured language.	0
"In March, the Northern Hemisphere reached the milestone mark of 3.6 degrees above normal preindustrial levels for the first time ever. Global warning, and not El Niño, has caused the record highs. ""The interesting thing is the scale at which we're breaking records,"" Andy Pitman, a climatologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia told The Guardian."	0
“We also talk about global averages and that’s a difficult term for many people because two degrees doesn’t seem like a lot. The more educated a population is about climate change, the more sceptical it is likely to be about claims that global warming will have catastrophic effects. “The new survey confirms once again what numerous surveys have found in recent years: educated and informed people in in the Western world are generally sceptical about alarmist climate predictions.	2
You retain all of that.” Yet even as climate change contributes to this population by the day, there remain many unknowns. Around 250 million people will be displaced globally by climate change by the year 2050. And while headlines often use the term “climate refugee,” those fleeing climate impacts are not protected by refugee status as it is defined by the U.N.	0
Flannery might be best known as the author of the bestselling book “The Weather Makers: The History and Future Impact of Climate Change.” Earlier this year he was named 2007 Australian of the Year. Global warming could wipe out more than half the earth’s species in the next few centuries. That finding appears in a new study published by researchers at the University of York.	0
We are still in the zone to turn our economy to making money off climate solutions versus making it worse.” But time is running out fast. The world only had a few decades, if even, to keep global future warming below 2 degrees Celsius and prevent practically all coral reefs from dying, more substantial sea level rise, and other catastrophic impacts. This post was updated with comments on the report's release timing from federal officials.	0
The latest emissions study is one of a number of recent efforts by scholars to understand the sources and effects of methane. Reservoirs may account for 1.3 percent of global methane emissions. This has raised concerns about the environmental viability of hydropower, particularly large hydropower projects, which has been the renewable energy source of choice for many developing countries.	1
One of the new numbers that’s a great concern to me is that we’ve been doing studies of how much organic matter is stored in these frozen soils in northern latitudes, permafrost soils, and the new numbers are that approximately a billion tons of carbon is stored in the organic matter in these high latitude soils. At high amounts of warming large fractions of the permafrost could melt, and some of the projections have that at from 60 to 90 percent of the permafrost melting. And the surprising thing about these permafrost soils is that the organic matter that’s contained within them is not this incredibly stabilized, difficult-to-decompose stuff; it’s basically frozen plants that have been sitting there for, in some cases, tens of thousands of years.	1
At Brown and Green, a loose network that includes teachers and engineers, members have not only marched and rallied but also joined local activists across the bay in Richmond, California, in fighting to reduce pollution from the large Chevron refinery there. We see often that the so-called villains of the large scale, often oil companies, are operating both at the local level and at the global level. “We need to fight them at all of those levels.” The urgency around climate change is pushing some newer immigrants to civic involvement for the first time.	1
Jerry Brown and other summit participants that the university’s 10 campuses will continue to act as “living laboratories” for climate change solutions. Addressing these challenges, and reducing our carbon footprint, is a moral imperative. Through the Carbon Neutrality Initiative, announced by Napolitano in 2013, UC is committed to making all buildings and vehicles associated with its 10 campuses carbon neutral by 2025.	0
Now, since we live in Texas, our electricity bill is far higher –- as much as five times higher — during our hot summers than during our mild winters. Like electricity should be more expensive if we want to burn fewer fossil fuels for power generation and do something to curb global warming. Looking on the other side of the ledger, we spend a higher percentage of our electricity dollars than I thought on appliances that are plugged into the wall that we are not using – like digital clocks on televisions and stoves that light up at all times.	0
"""Our assessment of the science finds that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice has diminished, the global mean sea level has risen and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,"" said Qin Dahe, co-chair of the working group that wrote the report. Climate models have failed to accurately predict global temperatures. A study in the journal Nature Climate Change compared 117 climate predictions made in the 1990&apos;s to the actual amount of warming."	2
"""Putting a price on carbon is a very important way to give an incentive to the private sector to develop technologies and take actions through market incentives through which they'll benefit,"" said Waxman. There are a lot of Republican economists who would like us to put a price on carbon. ""They see that a cap and trade or carbon tax could git in their view of, 'When we tax the things we don't want, we'll get less of it.'"	1
While others pursue investigations that may or may not bear fruit (but will surely enrich several generations of lawyers), I have an idea for something that could start now. Exxon, and perhaps the fossil fuel industry more generally, might help propel a vigorous new burst of research in ways to take back the CO2 added to the atmosphere by fossil fuel combustion at a scale that would matter to the climate system. (Those of us who benefitted from decades of cheap fossil fuels can do our part by supporting boosted federal investments in clean-energy science and technology development — and, yes, deployment.)	1
More recently, precipitation (both snow and rain) has dropped by 3.9 inches and temperatures have risen 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1992. The researchers suspect that the glacial melting in the Everest region is due to global warming, but they have not yet established a firm connection between the mountains&apos; changes and climate change. While Everest isn&apos;t the only Himalayan region seeing the effects of climate change, not all of the region&apos;s glaciers are melting.	1
Another presidential report prepared by the US intelligence community, Global Trends 2025, has climate change as a top talking point. Global climate change will have important and extensive implications for US national security interests over the next 20 years. In December, the Pentagon unveiled a controversial program to fund social science research.	0
"For his part, Schmidt says he expects the slowdown to speed up sooner rather than later. The increase in greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels and from land-use changes ""is unrelenting, and that, in the end, is going to dominate most of the other things that are going on"" that contribute to the slowdown. ""In five or 10 years' time, greenhouse gases dominate those things."""	0
"It has 7 percent of the world's population, but only 3 percent of its freshwater resources. Global warming may lead to less rainfall and more evaporation in the region, further reducing the supply of water. Half the world's ""water poor"" – that is, people whose access to freshwater is deemed inadequate – live in the Mediterranean region, mostly on the sea's eastern and southern shores."	0
That, however, could reverse in the coming years, Willis said. In the long run, we expect the sea levels on the west coast to catch up to global mean and even exceed the global mean. Florida is also particularly vulnerable to sea level rise because its porous soil allows more seawater intrusion than does the soil in other coastal areas, Willis said.	1
Although Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. A carbon tax is politically toxic. Governor Inslee, he said, is “going to find out real quickly that it doesn’t play in Peoria.” Even some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign.	1
While dairy cows are reared and milked indoors, where their ruminant gases can plausibly be gathered, beef cattle in outdoor feedlots do not present the same methane-recycling opportunities. Such tweaks will not be nearly enough to curb global warming. The plan's own emphasis on preparing for climate change seems to acknowledge this.	0
Other utilities in the state face similar requirements, and utility regulators across the United States are discussing whether to follow New York’s lead. But with a global failure to limit greenhouse gases, the risk is rising that climatic changes in coming decades could overwhelm such efforts to adapt. It cited a particular risk that in a hotter climate, farmers will not be able to keep up with the fast-rising demand for food.	0
The new numbers, reported by a tracking initiative called the Global Carbon Project and published in the journal Nature Geoscience, came on the eve of a United Nations summit meeting meant to harness fresh political ambition in tackling climate change. Vastly greater efforts would be needed to get long-term global warming within tolerable limits. “You can no longer have some countries go first and others come in later, because there is no more time,” said Glen P. Peters, a scientist at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo, who helped compile the new numbers.	0
Worldwide, the vast majority of glaciers measured below 15,000 feet have been shrinking in recent decades, said Richard Armstrong, a senior researcher with the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The rate at which they are diminishing is more or less parallel to the increase in the rate of global warming. University of Wyoming civil engineering graduate students Jake Edmunds, Derrick Thompson, and Jeb Bell found that Teton Glacier on 13,776-foot Grand Teton has lost about20 percent of its surface area over the past 40 years or so.	0
But while local politicians can take action to shore up their community against the rising tide, they are powerless to stop what scientists say is the heart of the problem: the increasing fossil fuel emissions that continue to warm the planet. The scale of emission reductions necessary to prevent the most dangerous effects of global warming can only come as a result of national and international policies to cut carbon pollution. Some areas of the globe are especially vulnerable to rising sea levels and inhabitants are being forced to make stark changes in their lives.	0
"For now, however, ""communities can begin to use this as part of their adaptation planning,"" she says. Several factors combine to determine sea-level rise in any one location. Local wind and ocean-circulation patterns, and even the West Coast's shifting crustal plates, which generate earthquakes and raise volcanoes, can play a role."	1
Today, Christians focus on their relationship with God, often choosing to give up something or to volunteer and give of themselves for others,” the United Methodist Church website states. Global warming is such an important issue they are giving up carbon for Lent. Yale Climate Connections reports: The weeks just before Easter are known as Lent.	0
Professor Bullard is trying to bring that message to working-class Americans like Mr. Guerra, and to environmental organizations that have, in his mind, been more focused on struggling animals than poor humans, who have been disproportionately harmed by increasing temperatures, worsening storms and rising sea levels. For too long, a lot of the climate change and global warming arguments have been looking at melting ice and polar bears and not at the human suffering side of it. “They are still pushing out the polar bear as the icon for climate change.	1
The Keystone XL pipeline would not substantially worsen carbon pollution, leaving an opening for President Obama to approve the politically divisive project. The department’s long-awaited environmental impact statement appears to indicate that the project could pass the criteria Mr. Obama set forth in a speech last summer when he said he would approve the 1,700-mile pipeline if it would not “significantly exacerbate” the problem of greenhouse gas emissions.	1
(Not that there’s anything wrong with that.) The typical American diet of something like 600 pounds of animal products a year is inconsistent with a progressive or even realistic view of slowing global warming. Or maybe he just wanted to lose some weight.	1
"In contrast, this new initiative is ""another sign of the President’s commitment to confronting the climate crisis at a time of partisan gridlock in Washington,"" said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, in a press statement. Methane pollution is an intense contributor to global climate change, and the White House methane strategy is a smart roadmap for taking on the biggest sources of emissions, including natural gas leaks from the oil and gas sector. The BLM estimates that 59 percent of coal is mined on private lands, and gas companies are rapidly buying residential parcels in shale-rich areas."	1
Global warming caused by human emissions has most likely intensified the drought in California by 15 to 20 percent. Even though the findings suggest that the drought is primarily a consequence of natural climate variability, the scientists added that the likelihood of any drought becoming acute is rising because of climate change.	0
Researchers and park officers outlined some of their concerns this week to a congressional subcommittee at a special hearing on the “Impacts of Climate Change on America’s National Parks” here in Twentynine Palms, Calif. M. Rebecca Shaw, director of conservation for the Nature Conservancy of California, told the panel, “An explosion of studies in the last five years has documented observed climate impacts on species distributions, wildfire frequency and intensity, pest outbreaks, and sea-level rise.” “Keeping wildlife populations, rivers, forests, deserts, and our national parks healthy will allow us to support nearly 6.5 million existing jobs and continue to generate $88 billion in state and national tax revenue,” Cipra told the panel, pointing to a 2006 study by the Outdoor Industry Association, which found that fishing, hunting, hiking, and other outdoor pursuits contribute $730 billion annually to the US economy. Global warming exists. “These scientists know that if they do research and the results are in no way alarming, their research will gather dust on the shelf and their research careers will languish,” said Mr. Coleman.	0
And the distribution of some water-borne illnesses and the insects that spread them has expanded to new areas. Overall, evidence for global warming's effect on the planet is most obvious in changes to natural systems. As for the future, one concern centers on the rates of change projected if emissions follow projections built on plausible medium to high emission rates.	0
"A team of European researchers are out with a new study that will ""infuriate"" climate change activists warning of melting glaciers as a result of global warming. The earth is likely to undergo a ""mini ice age"" that may last about a decade. Northumbria University professor Valentina Zharkova said it's something that hasn't been experienced since the 1600s and that the freeze could occur between 2030 and 2040."	0

"The new study, however, finds no ""tipping point"" now or in this century in Arctic sea-ice decline, but rather a relatively steady fall-off in ice extent as average temperatures increase. This gives cause for hope that once greenhouse-gas concentrations stabilize, the average temperatures in the Arctic would respond in ways that would keep the sea ice from declining further, although natural shifts in seasonal weather patterns would continue to play its role in varying sea-ice extent from one year to the next. ""Polar bears do not appear to be doomed by what we have contributed already"" to atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, says Cecilia Bitz, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle and a member of the team reporting its results in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature."	2
Hamilton steered me to an article by James Manzi and Peter Wehner in his favorite magazine, National Affairs. According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the expected economic costs of unaddressed global warming over the next century are likely to be about 3 percent of world gross domestic product. This is a big, gradual problem, but not the sort of cataclysmic immediate threat that’s likely to lead people to suspend their immediate self-interest.	1
"""This pressure difference intensifies the equatorial Pacific trade winds, which in turn suck up colder water in the eastern Pacific and pile up warm water in the western Pacific,"" explains University of Hawaii oceanographer Axel Timmermann, a member of the team conducting the study. The hiatus in measured global warming could persist. Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox."	1
Climate change is probably contributing to the menace posed by storms like Florence. While many scientists are wary of drawing firm links between any particular storm and climate change, a rising sea level adds to the destructiveness of storm surges, and a warming atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to more rain. A study last December estimated that Hurricane Harvey’s rainfall total last year was 38 percent higher than it would have been in a world without climate change.	0
But reclaiming land from the ocean has its limits, particularly in an age of a warming planet. By 2100, sea levels may rise by as much as six feet, and furious storms will pound our coasts. All over the world, the governments of small islands are working to respond to these hazards.	0
Moreover, some research suggested potentially huge crop gains from a sort of counterintuitive ace in the hole: the very increase in carbon dioxide that is causing the planet to warm. Higher carbon dioxide levels in the future might give crops a major boost. But that work was done under artificial conditions, such as in greenhouses.	2
Caldeira wasn't part of this study, but has a separate study of beef's greenhouse gas footprint around the world, published this month in the journal Climatic Change. The average American who switches from beef to pork would reduce the equivalent of 1,200 pounds of carbon dioxide a year, which is about nine days' worth of the nation's per capita greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA calculates that it is the same as the emissions from 61 gallons of gas or what comes out of the smokestack from burning 580 pounds of coal.	1
In the post, climate change skeptic and blogger Steven Goddard states that Antarctic sea ice reached its highest level ever recorded for the 256th day of the calendar year on Sept. 12. The Southern Hemisphere must be balancing the warming of the Northern Hemisphere by becoming colder (and thus, net global warming is zero). The National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC), which tracks sea ice using satellite data, explains on its website why Antarctic ice has weathered global warming more robustly than Arctic ice.	2
Despite their academic credentials, none have the publication record of an accomplished expert in the field, though they may be lauded by the conservative media. Some legitimate uncertainty about the human contribution to global warming did exist within my specialty of paleoclimatology several decades ago. Since then, however, high-quality climate reconstructions from ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments and other geological sources, coupled with rigorous analyses of solar activity, volcanism and fossil fuel emissions, have made it clear that the recent warming is not simply a result of natural variability or cycles.	1
Many supporters of legislative action also argue that the worst-case cost scenarios ignore the price of inaction. Global warming could result in expensive increases in hurricane damage and other climate-related costs. “Climate change is on a collision course with the US economy, long before the end of the century, unless we act now,” said Frank Ackerman, a Tufts University economist and coauthor of a recent study on the economic effects of global warming, on May 22.	0
Along the East Coast's hot spot, by contrast, the team's measurements suggest that subsidence isn't a significant player in the acceleration it found. The pace is most consistent with the slowing of Atlantic currents along the coast, either from warming waters, melting ice, or some combination.

“What this project reveals is the scope there is to achieve climate mitigation in the existing petroleum sector.” That project is Carnegie’s new oil-climate index, produced in collaboration with Stanford University and the University of Calgary. The spread between the carbon emissions from the worst and the best kinds of crude is large. And the researchers say the spread will likely be larger when more types of crude oil are added to the index, since the 30 oils tested represent only about 5 percent of global production.	1
"Habitats are fragmented, often with no ""corridors"" connecting them to allow for easy migration. Plants and animals in mountain regions, on the other hand, appear to face a lower risk of being overtaken by global warming, because mountains exhibit large temperature swings with altitude. The exception: organisms that live on mountain summits and have nowhere else to go."	2
"Let us bring it to the fore and figure out how we are going to take that to scale in a timely fashion to that we can actually bridge that gap,"" Ms. Fugueres said. In the energy sector, responsible for two-thirds of the greenhouse-gas emissions globally, major emitters are making progress. In the US, for instance, greenhouse-gas emissions for each kilowatt-hour of electricity produced has fallen since 2003 to mid-1990s levels, a decline driven by economic downturn but also by the increased availability of relatively inexpensive natural gas extracted from once-marginal reservoirs by fracturing, or ""fracking."""	1
All forms of intensive energy-harvesting will have feedbacks, even if some are more powerful than others. Extracting energy from wind power on a huge scale can cause its own global climate consequences. When it comes to building world-girdling civilizations, there are no planetary free lunches.	0

Although Western farmers are among the most politically conservative groups in the country, many of them acknowledge the changing climate and say they want the bureau to make the changes necessary to support them. Over the coming century, the impact of human-caused global warming will diminish the once-thick snowpack across the Sierra Nevada and other Western ranges. “We have enough guys noticing that things are changing, and most of these models suggest we’re going to have more intense weather,” said Dan Keppen, the executive director of the Family Farm Alliance in Klamath Falls, Ore. “The snowpack is going to run off quicker and heavier in the spring, and there will be drier growing seasons.” An interactive map shows how much water California residents conserved in April and how much daily consumption they are being forced to cut under new mandatory restrictions.	0
But if anything like the scenario in the paper were to play out in the real world, the problems would go far beyond a rise of the sea and a retreat from the coasts. Burning all fossil fuels might raise the average temperature of the planet by something like 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Past research suggests that an increase that enormous would likely render vast stretches of the earth too hot and humid for human habitation, cause food production to collapse, and drive much of the plant and animal life of the planet to extinction.	1
statement said that repealing the measure “will also facilitate the development of U.S. energy resources and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens associated with the development of those resources.” The repeal proposal, which will be filed in the Federal Register on Tuesday, fulfills a promise President Trump made to eradicate his predecessor’s environmental legacy. The United States can fulfill its promise as part of the Paris climate agreement to ratchet down emissions that are warming the planet and contributing to heat waves and sea-level rise. Mr. Trump has vowed to abandon that international accord.	0
Hungary worried the report would provide ammunition for skeptics. The rise in global average temperatures stopped in the late 1990s. Meanwhile, Arctic sea ice melted to a record low last year and the IPCC draft said sea levels have risen by 7.5 inches (19 centimeters) since 1901.	2
While some island nations may be wiped out by a rise of that magnitude, experts believe most major cities could be protected from it, though at a likely cost in the trillions of dollars. It simply takes longer than a century for large-scale melting to begin. But from that point, the paper found, about half the Antarctic ice sheet would melt or fall into the sea in the first thousand years.	2
Climate scientists are giving science a bad name, says a leading atmospheric physicist in an essay on the global warming debate. Many climate scientists are much less sure about man-made global warming than they will admit in public. But rather than reach out to skeptics in order to open up the debate and explore the uncertainties, they have instead closed ranks and rubbished anyone who disagrees with them: Some of the more vocal of the establishment climate researchers have fallen into a mode of open denigration of climate sceptics (“deniers” is the offensive popular terminology of the day).	1
Take the quiz. Fossil fuels are the primary source of about 375 billion tonnes of carbon that has been released into the atmosphere since the industrial era began in 1750. WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said the billions of tonnes of extra carbon dioxide would stay in the atmosphere for centuries, causing the planet to warm further.	1

Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Global warming alone is projected to affect roughly 30 percent of the Earth in ways that would require species to migrate at rates higher than those inferred from the fossil record as they spread during the end of the last ice age. Meanwhile, from interstate highways to urban sprawl, humans have erected more barriers to that migration.	0
"One element the report doesn't appear to address is the apparent mismatch between its envisioned planning horizon for investments – the next 15 years – and the IPCC's estimate that to achieve the 2-degree goal, emissions have to peak by 2020 and decline thereafter. Policies, technologies, and incentives such as a global price on carbon are in place now, with the world in effect hitting the ground running today. ""We take on a 15-year time frame because we feel that a 30-year time frame becomes less meaningful from a planning perspective."	1
In Europe, the cradle of ski culture, the problem is even worse. Half the glacial ice in the Alps has already melted. For the American ski industry, the impact has already been pronounced.	1
"[Extreme Life on Earth: 8 Bizarre Creatures] In a statement that dubs Earth&aposs deep biosphere a ""subterranean Galapagos"" waiting to be studied, DCO scientists estimate that the sheer biomass of carbon-based life lurking below our feet utterly dwarfs the amount of life roaming the Earth&aposs surface. There is nearly 300 to 400 times as much carbon biomass underground (most of it still undiscovered) as there is in all the humans on Earth. ""Even in dark and energetically challenging conditions, intraterrestrial ecosystems have uniquely evolved and persisted over millions of years,"" Fumio Inagaki, a geomicrobiologist at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and DCO member, said in the statement."	1
The plaintiffs filed their 103-page response Monday morning, which means the Court has a tight window to decide whether to let the trial begin, as previously scheduled, on October 29. The US government has known for decades that carbon dioxide emissions are endangering the planet. By allowing the production of fossil fuels to continue, the lawsuit alleges, the plaintiffs’ constitutional right to life, liberty, and property is being violated, in addition to their public trust rights.	0
The Pew Research Center, for instance, found that 33 percent of the public believes “Humans and other living things have existed in their present form since the beginning of time” and 26 percent think there is not “solid evidence that the average temperature on Earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades.” Unsurprisingly, beliefs on both topics are divided along religious and partisan lines. There is not solid evidence of global warming. As a result of surveys like these, scientists and advocates have concluded that many people are not aware of the evidence on these issues and need to be provided with correct information.	2
The scientists behind the new study said they analyzed more detailed information about China’s coal quality, combustion performance across industries and total energy consumption than had previously been used. We measured thousands of samples of coal from mines across China, and found that the carbon content of the coal being burned in China is actually much lower than what has been assumed in previous estimates of emissions. Estimating a country’s carbon dioxide emissions entails some scientific detective work.	1
“And so we see a very persistent, hot spot there in terms of temperature differences from what they should be.” Research suggests that the hot spot, along with changes in the jet stream driven by climate change, cause the polar vortex to break down in mid- to late winter. As the Arctic gets warmer and warmer, the severe weather picks up. In October, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted a milder than average winter, but that is not necessarily at odds with the January chill.	0
"""If Larsen C now starts to retreat significantly and eventually collapses, then we will see another contribution to sea level rise,"" said Professor David Vaughan, glaciologist and Director of Science at British Antarctic Survey, in a statement. There is little doubt that climate change is causing ice shelves to disappear in some parts of Antarctica at the moment. SPACE BREAKTHROUGH: SCIENTISTS TELEPORT PHOTON FROM EARTH TO ORBIT The professor said though some parts of Antarctica are losing ice due to ocean change, significant warming in the last several decades have contributed to ice shelves collapsing."	0
The other major sink is the ocean, and it appears to be growing less cooperative as well. The fraction of CO2 emissions from human activity appears to have declined by about 5 percent between 1959 and 2008, essentially as the sinks themselves respond to global warming. That response appears to be driving the decline the new study records, Running says.	2
They say they help finance projects that benefit indigenous people. Carbon offsets do more harm than help for native peoples. He says indigenous people from Canada to South America are being pushed off land for incoming carbon projects, and often do not share in the economic benefits created by these offset projects.	2
Worldwide levels of the chief greenhouse gas that causes global warming have hit a milestone, reaching an amount never before encountered by humans. Carbon dioxide was measured at 400 parts per million at the oldest monitoring station in Hawaii which sets the global benchmark.	0
The trend will likely continue because of global warming. Janet Gardner, an Australian National University biologist, led a team of scientists who measured museum specimens to plot the decline in size of eight species of Australian birds over the past century.	0
"Scientists are calling for an 80-percent cut in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 to stop the world from overheating, but many governments are lagging behind the curve, fearful that the public is not ready for austerity measures. People would never accept carbon rationing. ""If people are doing it voluntarily, then it really puts the government on the defensive,"" Mr. Monbiot adds."	1
We have caused the Earth to wobble, and it’s getting worse. Ice at both ends of the Earth is melting far faster, and oceans are warming far faster, than previously thought, suggesting that scientific estimates of a warming planet have been too conservative. Those are the headlines that should be causing real concern.	0
Even Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein were not immune from the problem. It is nonetheless the case that once freed of the burden of having to earn a living or retain their tenure in an academe in thrall to the man-made global warming narrative. It seems that scientists too are conscious of the need to eat, and like everyone else must consider the consequences of public dissent from the views of the powers-that-be.	2
The IPCC acknowledged the same thing in their AR5 Report in 2013. and 2) We have satellite records clearly documenting a shrinkage of the Antarctic ice sheet and an acceleration of that shrinkage Again, this is a fake claim. According to a NASA study in 2015, the land ice is actually growing in Antarctica. The research challenges the conclusions of other studies, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2013 report, which says that Antarctica is overall losing land ice.	1
Hydraulic fracturing has produced an abundance of inexpensive natural gas, leading to a shift away from coal in electricity production. The United States reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the lowest level since the mid-1990s, even as emissions rise globally. We need to export this technology and help other nations exploit it.	1
But over the past year, President Obama has proposed a series of Environmental Protection Agency regulations intended to reduce carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, which Republicans in Congress have attacked as a “war on coal.” But those positions appear to be out of step with the majority of the electorate. If nothing is done to reduce emissions, global warming will be a very or somewhat serious problem in the future. But substantial differences remain between the two parties on the issue.	0
“She might make it. Reining in carbon emissions is both futile and unnecessary, and that money is better spent adapting to what he says will be moderately higher temperatures. Among other initiatives, he said, the authorities could limit development in coastal and hurricane-prone areas, expand flood plains, make manufactured housing more resistant to tornadoes and high winds, and make farms in arid regions less dependent on imported water — or move production to rainier places.	2
The cleanup costs after storms like Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina are in the tens of billions. Extreme storms will be much more frequent as a result of global warming. The damage becomes that much worse as sea level rises.	0
“Trade changes the location of production and thus affects emissions.” Powerful global winds called westerlies can carry pollutants from China across the Pacific within days, leading to “dangerous spikes in contaminants,” especially during the spring, according to a news release from the University of California, Irvine, where one of the study’s co-authors, Steven J. Davis, is an earth system scientist. Dust, ozone and carbon can accumulate in valleys and basins in California and other Western states. Black carbon is a particular problem because rain does not wash it out of the atmosphere, so it persists across long distances, the statement said.	1
The team used the data to investigate the flow of the Dotson ice shelf, a 30-mile-wide (50 kilometers) expanse off the remote coast of Marie Byrd Land. Melting is not uniform. This under-ice canyon is probably formed by relatively warm ocean water — 33.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius — that circulates clockwise and upward due to the planet&aposs rotation, Gourmelen said.	1
All of which heightens the debate over climate change – which 97 percent of climate scientists (according to NASA) say has been dramatically influenced by human activities. A comprehensive and long-range plan to tackle global warming has yet to be passed. Consequently, President Obama has issued some executive orders dealing with the root causes of climate change.	1
The U.N. panel of climate scientists has estimated that sea levels will rise by between 18 and 59 cm (7-24 inches) this century, more if thaws of Antarctica and Greenland accelerate. Antarctica alone will make sea levels fall by between 2 and 14 cms this century because more snowfall will extract water from the sea. But Sunday's study said that Antarctica was losing about 250 billion tonnes of ice a year - equivalent to 0.07 millimetre (0.003 inch) of sea level rise a year, Bintanja said.	0
“The tobacco industry knew for years and years and years and decades, that smoking would kill people, would harm people and create cancer, and were hiding that fact from the people and denied it. Every gas station on it, every car should have a warning label on it, every product that has fossil fuels should have a warning label on it. Suggesting that the question of whether humans are causing global warming is settled — and, according to Schwarzenegger, has been settled for decades — is irresponsible.	0
Global emissions of carbon dioxide are slowing somewhat from the rapid pace of the last decade. Scientists compiling the numbers said it was unclear whether the slowdown in the growth of emissions might represent the beginnings of a permanent shift.	1
"Those numbers don't tell the whole story, divestment activists counter. The threat of future regulations, geopolitical instability, and overestimated reserves make fossil fuels financially risky. ""In a very realistic, investment-centric view, one should be concerned about owning fossil fuels,"" says Mr. Streur of Portfolio 21."	1
Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Natural climate swings are playing a greater role in the loss of ice from West Antarctica than global warming. If conditions are largely governed by conditions in the tropical Pacific, as they appear to be, an ability to project the ice sheet's future in a warmer world depends on researcher's ability to figure out whether El Niño conditions will predominate in the future, or La Niña conditions – El Niño's opposite.	2
Temperatures in parts of Alberta were as much as 30 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the weeks before the fires began, desiccating the landscape. The overall increase in fire in northern regions would not be happening without global warming. The rising danger was predicted decades ago, as one of the likely consequences of human emissions.	0
“The Obama administration’s pledge to the United Nations today will not see the light of day with the 114th Congress,” Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (R) of Oklahoma said in a statement Tuesday. China to continue to expand its energy infrastructure and increase emissions through 2030 while American taxpayers and businesses foot the bill of his extremist global warming agenda. Many of the actions being taken by Obama to meet the US’s commitment will be “difficult to undo because they’re under existing laws,” Mr. Deese said.	2
China, India and other developing Asian economies have resisted American urging to commit to reductions in their own carbon emissions, arguing that the United States, the world’s largest economy, should shoulder most of the economic burden. Action by the United States alone will not slow global warming significantly unless other large economies commit to carbon cuts, as well. China recently surpassed the United States as the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and emissions across Asia are projected to surge in the coming decades as millions more people in the developing economies there begin to drive automobiles and gain access to electric power.	1
“I don’t know what the environmental policy of the Republican Party is.” Though he voted for an amendment in January stating climate change is real, Mr. Cruz has repeatedly questioned the role humans play in it. Global warming is not supported by data, despite scientific consensus to the contrary. And though questioning climate science polls poorly with the general electorate – only 27 percent were more likely to vote for a candidate staking such a position – the New York Times poll found 49 percent of Tea Party voters were more likely to pick a candidate who avoids taking a stand on climate change.	2
So far, 55 have made that pledge or promised better. Parks help cities become more resilient and sustainable as communities and governments try to lighten their carbon footprints and prepare for climate change. Many of the cities with the 10 highest scores seem like no-brainers, given their world-famous parks systems or culture of environmental awareness — Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Portland, Ore., New York City and Boston are all in the top 10.	0
Our state is well-positioned to make enacting this law an opportunity, both economically and environmentally, rather than a burden, as some naysayers suggest. The most expensive option for California is inaction in fighting global warming.	0
The report estimates that a third of all the food produced in the world is never consumed, and the total cost of that food waste could be as high as $400 billion a year. Reducing food waste from 20 to 50 percent globally could save $120 billion to $300 billion a year by 2030. “Food waste is a global issue, and tackling it is a priority,” said Richard Swannell, director of sustainable food systems at the Waste and Resources Action Program, or Wrap, an antiwaste organization in Britain that compiled the new report.	1
“I mean, it’s a moneymaking industry, O.K.? The global fight against climate change is a threat to the American economy. In his speech withdrawing from the Paris accord, the president said the agreement imposes “draconian financial and economic burdens” that are “unfair, at the highest level, to the United States.” Mr. Trump could quietly publish the special report this year and the broader assessment when the final version is due in 2018.	1
University of East Anglia Professor Karen Heywood, who also worked on the study, said the presence of volcanoes just means there&apos;s an additional source of heat to melt the ice. It will be important to include this in our efforts to estimate whether the Antarctic ice sheet might become unstable and further increase sea level rise. Last year, significant parts of the Pine Island Glacier separated from the main shelf.	1
"Rather than determining ""facts on the ground"" in order to enable policymakers to ""run cost/benefit analyses based on the real world,"" the EPA ""models assume the question ahead of time, so don't constitute independent evidence of it."" With respect to climate change, it has yet to be determined precisely what the role of human activity is, and in particular, how sensitive the climate is to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide. ""What is fairly clear is that most of the models predict about twice the rate of warming as we actually observe."	2
Worldwide, clean-energy investment fell 12 percent last year. Europe become a global leader in reducing greenhouse gases. It is already nearing its target of reducing 1990-level greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020.	1
Have you ever heard anybody say he couldn’t comment on tax policy because he wasn’t an accountant? The scientists are wrong when they say global warming is real. They act like people who don’t want to have to face up to the facts and come up with solutions.	2
"He is also part of a task force that three Florida counties have formed to tackle sea-rise and global-warming issues. Action is needed now to counter effects from a further rise in sea level. ""There are those who take a position that it's not happening at all."	0
“China is willing to enhance cooperation with all sides to together advance the follow-up negotiations on details of implementing the Paris Agreement and also advance its effective implementation,” Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the ministry, said at a regular briefing in Beijing. Climate change is a global problem, and requires that the international community cooperate in its response. Fiji, among the island nations most threatened by rising sea levels, is to be the focus of the next international conference on climate change, in November in Bonn, Germany.	0
Other scientists have predicted more modest rises. Seas in the region could rise five to six feet by 2100. “There is no doubt that preparations within Bangladesh have been utterly inadequate, but any such preparations are bound to fail because the problem is far too big for any single government,” said Tariq A. Karim, Bangladesh’s ambassador to India.	0
A solid majority of Alaskans, 63 percent, said they support taxing fossil fuel companies while equally reducing other taxes, according to data released this week from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Alaskans have something of an appetite for a carbon tax. Rose is also buoyed by the fact that the state’s residents are used to the idea of paying for pollution.	1
They believe, based on computer simulations of hiatus periods and measurements from new floating sensors, they can account for the “missing” heat, much of which they believe is deep in the ocean, more than 700 meters below the water’s surface. Climate-change skeptics earn mainstream adherents last year, as global temperatures hung perilously close to falling beneath even the lowest model projections. “Apocalypse perhaps a little later,” as The Economist put it.	2
In front of the Flatiron Building, on Fifth Avenue, a 3,000-pound ice sculpture spelled out “The Future.” Dripping onto the sidewalk, it had been carved over two days in Queens by a group of Japanese ice sculptors. We are melting down the future. “It’s a comment on what we are doing to the planet.” At Columbus Circle, there were bare-breasted women and people with dreadlocks and homespun clothing.	0
Dr. Seager of Columbia University pointed out that much of the Southwestern United States had been in a drought of fluctuating severity for 15 years. Winter precipitation to fall as rain rather than snow, meaning less melting snowpack to help parched states through the hotter summers. “It all adds up across the Southwest to an increasingly stressed water system,” he said.	0
Generally, however, negative effects on crops are more common than positive effects. Changes in rain and snowfall patterns and melting glaciers are reducing water availability and quality in many regions. Affects on human health to this point are harder to quantify, according to the panel.	0
The main conclusions have not changed, and that debate seems likely to be replayed in the coming weeks. By burning fossil fuels at a prodigious pace and pouring heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere, humanity is about to provoke an abrupt climate shift. Specifically, the authors believe that fresh water pouring into the oceans from melting land ice will set off a feedback loop that will cause parts of the great ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to disintegrate rapidly.	0
Public communication, however, required charisma, power, and clear translation. Throughout her career, the global lack of action to slow climate change had become an increasingly alarming issue. She began to pounce on every course, conference, and any other opportunity to practice speaking publicly about science.	0
May you know it!” While sea levels may not have been rising then, as they are now, changes in the water temperature may have been to blame for making life virtually unlivable in parts of the region. The surface temperatures of the Mediterranean Sea cooled rapidly during this time, severely reducing precipitation over the coasts. The study concluded that agriculture would have suffered and that the conditions might have influenced the “population declines, urban abandonments and long-distance migrations associated with the period.” To top it off, catastrophic events, in the form of a series of earthquakes, also rocked many ancient cities in these areas from around 1225 to 1175 B.C.	1
The proposed changes to the ESA, Mr. Paolino says, would clarify the Interior secretary’s belief that the ESA is not the right mechanism for regulating climate change. Science at this point cannot make the link between the specific greenhouse-gas emissions from, say, Kansas, and link it to the effect on a subset of polar bears or an individual polar bear in the Arctic region. As for the reduced number of federal scientific reviews of projects, he believes it will allow the Fish & Wildlife scientists to give more time to projects that are more likely to affect listed species.	2
Continued global warming poses a risk of rapid, drastic changes in some human and natural systems. At the same time, some worst-case fears about climate change that have entered the popular imagination can be ruled out as unlikely, at least over the next century, the panel found.	0
"Even ""if the United States reduced its emissions to zero, it would have no impact on global warming, because Chinese emissions have gone up so rapidly."" The U.S. going back to the stone age will not do anything to stop global warming. As for global warming, the false impression of a crisis is ""driven by alarmists who use scary computer model predictions, which have been completely falsified by the actual temperature data."""	1
No environmental correspondent, it’s true, would have had the advanced math skills that Nic Lewis used to find the paper false. There is not one science or environment correspondent attached to any mainstream media publication prepared to do their due diligence on global warming scare stories. They are all so wedded to the alarmist consensus that they scarcely even bother to alter the press release.	2
This summer, Mr. Gates pledged to spend $1 billion of his personal fortune on researching and deploying clean energy technology, but the people with knowledge of his plans said the new fund would include larger commitments. If we create the right environment for innovation, we can accelerate the pace of progress, develop and deploy new solutions, and eventually provide everyone with reliable, affordable energy that is carbon free. We can avoid the worst climate-change scenarios while also lifting people out of poverty, growing food more efficiently and saving lives by reducing pollution.” Mr. Gates met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India in September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.	1
This week, the Berkeley City Council issued a resolution declaring a worldwide climate emergency, calling it “the greatest crisis in history” after evoking memories of World War II. The United States of America has disproportionately contributed to the climate and ecological crises and to preventing a transition away from fossil fuels, and Americans thus bear an extraordinary responsibility to solve the crises. Apparently the six million Jews massacred during the Second World War, not to mention the other tens of millions of casualties, do not measure up to the overarching evils of climate change—at least in the minds of the Berkeley City Council.	0
Nevertheless, Republicans have included Arctic drilling in the Senate bill because they know that they don’t have the votes to approve this spectacularly bad idea under regular order. Climate change is upon us and that the last thing we should do is double down on drilling for oil, especially in a national treasure like the Arctic refuge. When the refuge was last under serious attack in 2005, pro-environment Republicans in the House stood together and helped ensure that it remained protected.	0
(The Associated Press) The oceans are under attack and all signs point toward humans as the perpetrators. Sea temperatures are rising. For most accounts, the future for plants and animals on Earth looks pretty grim.	0
Worse, said Wester, the monsoon is also becoming more erratic and prone to extreme downpours. One-in-100 year floods are starting to happen every 50 years. The new report highlights how vulnerable many mountain people are, with one-third living on less than $1.90 a day and far away from help if climate disaster strikes.	1
To slow global warming, it is critical that millions of people change their personal habits and behaviors. The best place to begin is air travel, with its big carbon footprint. Annually the average American produces 19 tons of CO2.	0
To back that up, Huertas points to data that show that solar activity and temperature rose together from 1880 until 1960, but that then, solar activity stopped increasing -- even as temperatures continued going up. Solar activity has varied a bit while global temperature keeps going up. But Rawls said that while solar activity has indeed stopped increasing, the important thing is that it remains at a historically high level.	1
Humans are not to blame for global warming. This will save the Katrinas and Sandys of the world from the injustice of having their names attached to major disaster, the group says.	2
The region has been gaining ice due to increases in snow accumulation, according to 2015 research. Global warming can increase snowfall by boosting the amount of moisture in the air. The Roi Baudouin crater was more mysterious still.	0
In addition, once the carbon dioxide is scrubbed – either at the smokestack or from the air itself – storing it for hundreds to thousands of years to keep it out of the atmosphere brings its own set of environmental concerns. Some form of carbon capture and storage (or recycling) ultimately will be needed to counter global warming. Economies continue to pump CO2 into the atmosphere at a significant pace.	0
Suddenly the tidings from Svalbard were everywhere, in multiple languages, with headlines like “World’s ‘Doomsday’ Seed Vault Has Been Breached by Climate Change.” It didn’t matter that the flood happened seven months earlier, or that the seeds remained safe and dry. We had just lived through the third consecutive year of the highest global temperatures on record and the lowest levels of Arctic ice. All these facts felt like signposts to an increasingly hopeless future for the planet.	0
Though the city’s many competing financial interests mean there are typically few spending guarantees, particularly on projects intended to span decades, officials insist the money will be incorporated in its 10-year capital plan, to be released early next year. Global warming was much more of an abstraction to New York City until two years ago. “There’s a moral imperative to act.” But with a global audience looking toward New York this week, as world leaders including President Obama converge to discuss climate change, Mr. de Blasio is training attention not just on its waterfront but on its skyline: The city — dense and walkable, with an extensive subway system — has long been more environmentally friendly than most.	1
“The shift to additional natural gas use is a key contributor to helping the U.S. reduce energy-related emissions and improve air quality.” Those who oppose natural gas pipelines say the science is on their side. Methane, the chief component of natural gas, is a powerful greenhouse gas in the short term, with more than 80 times the effect of carbon dioxide in its first 20 years in the atmosphere. The Obama administration is issuing regulations to reduce leaks, but environmental opposition to fracking, and events like the huge methane plume released at a storage facility in the Porter Ranch neighborhood near Los Angeles, have helped embolden the movement.	1
Some scientists say an ice age was prevented thousands of years ago by the dawn of human agriculture – deforestation and farming released enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to prevent another global cool down, the theory goes. New farming techniques will put some of that carbon back into the ground and help stem the rising tide of global warming. No-till agriculture, in which farmers don’t plow their fields anymore, is one practice said to promote carbon sequestration in the soil.	0
"The Christian Science Monitor profiled American geologist Kerry Sieh, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, when he traveled to Aceh to examine exposed sea cliff features along the ocean to observe the layers of sand that past tsunamis have dumped onto the island. The sea level used to be much higher, and that tsunamis over the years have washed more and more sand on the shore, which created natural layers that could give Mr. Sieh a clue towards the frequency of tsunamis over time. In many ways geologists have to work in reverse for this method dubbed ""paleo-geology."""	1
That finding can be instructive, Ms. Perren said. There are natural ways to address the modern global warming problem. “We’re always searching for these great technologies that will do it on a megascale, but the most efficient way you can pull CO₂ out of the atmosphere is with trees,” she said.	0
Mr. Koch and his family have funded conservative causes, including scientists and organizations that contest the role of humans in climate change. Many fossil-fuel companies have made similar contributions to such organizations and scientists over the years. The letter is a project of the Natural History Museum, a mobile museum that draws attention to “social and political forces that shape nature yet are left out of traditional natural history museums,” said its co-founder and director, Beka Economopoulos.	1
“No one would argue that a recession is the way to solve our climate problems,” says Manish Bapna, executive vice president and managing director of the World Resources Institute. It puts a little time back on the carbon clock. “But it’s not something you can count on.” “It’s not a blockbuster impact,” adds Frank O’Donnell, president of Clean Air Watch.	1
"It even raises, as an earlier report did, the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food. And ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life. Without changes in greenhouse gas emissions, ""climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century,"" the report says."	0
“More CO2 is staying in the atmosphere instead of being absorbed by the ocean and land sinks, like trees and other vegetation,” said Richard Feely, an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle and a member of the team producing the report. If the natural sinks can't keep pace with the increased CO2 emissions, then the physical and biological impacts of global warming will accelerate over the next century. Many countries have agreed in principle to try to stabilize emissions at 350 parts-per-million by century's end.	0
"Furthermore, it is far from ""settled"" that human activity is the main or even a primary source behind climate change. Just how vacuous the global warming narrative has become. In 1988, confident scientists predicted the sinking of the Maldives islands in 30 years."	2
"The result might help resolve a long-standing discrepancy between changes in rainfall projected in global climate models and changes projected by studying the historical record, researchers say. Carbon dioxide has a fundamentally different mode of warming than natural climate change. While the effect is most pronounced the the Pacific basin, the work ""is about something more fundamental.... Natural and human-caused climate change really produce different effects."""	1
The buildup of CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels, as well as from land-use changes. These new results will help us answer important questions in terms of both sea-level rise and how the planet's cold regions are responding to global change. Retreating mountain glaciers have become among the most prominent icons of global warming.	1
Leaking landfills can pollute groundwater. Separating waste by type is anything but fussy, especially in the age of climate change, when scientists have shown that global warming is producing wetter storms and contributing to more destructive storm surges, and could also be making some storms more powerful. “I fully understand people saying, ‘This is an emergency — let’s suspend the norms,’ ” Ms. Enck said.	0
But scientists can justly claim to have demonstrated some predictive skill about many of the potential implications of the human release of greenhouse gases. Emissions of carbon dioxide would cause the planet to warm. It took more than 80 years to be sure he was right.	0
The Republican state party chairwoman, Susan Hutchison, said she thought that argument would backfire with voters in a state that already has one of the most environmentally friendly, low-carbon-emission energy profiles in the nation with its reliance on hydropower. Carrying a climate agenda even further, through measures like a carbon tax on gasoline, natural gas and other products, would hurt ordinary Washingtonians. “With Steyer’s very radical environmental agenda, we’ve got the possibility of gas costing a dollar more per gallon,” she said.	2
Although the IPCC has dealt with the subject all along, adaptation is seen by many activist groups on global warming as a cop-out – a topic aimed at diverting attention from the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Even if countries slammed the brakes on emissions today, the climate would continue to warm because carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for centuries. The gradual-but-relentless build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution is an indication that humans are pumping it into the air faster than natural processes can remove the excess.	0
"The full statement during the town hall does indicate that Clinton was trying to make a larger point as she said ""we don't want to forget those people"" who worked in the coal mines for generations. Now we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce the energy that we relied on. But her answer doesn't seem to be enough for many voters in Kentucky who still have her initial line reverberating in their heads."	0
"""Most of these people are in very hot climates and don't have air conditioning, like India or Indonesia."" Global warming might become a problem. ""The crisis has been manufactured in order to create a huge climate industrial complex that can command the redistribution of colossal amounts of money."""	1
Religious conservatives who oppose environmentalism profess a deep concern for the plight of the poor. Economic success has historically been closely linked to the use of fossil fuels. “The policies meant to mitigate global warming would oppress the poor by depriving them of the energy without which they cannot rise out of poverty,” E. Calvin Beisner, a leader of an American group called the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, declared this year in Rome at a symposium held to pre-emptively counter Francis’ message.	1
The standard pattern is a drought during the summer, with much of the state’s annual rainfall coming in torrents over a few winter days. Heat waves in recent years have become more intense, a consequence of global warming. “The overall trend over decades to more intense and more frequent heat waves is definitely a signal of global warming,” Mr. Swain said.	0
A shrinking Greenland ice sheet – losing mass because of global warming – may be closer to its point of no return than previously estimated. If global average temperatures reach 1.6 degrees C (2.9 degrees F.) above preindustrial levels, the iconic ice sheet probably will tip toward irreversible loss. With a rise already of 0.8 degrees C, global average temperatures already are halfway there.	0
Despite current trends, the study found that more than 60 percent of respondents from both the public and selected “opinion formers” — people considered influential in fields like politics, business, media, the arts, health education and the law — believe that Britain should remain a “great power,” the highest level since the survey was first conducted in 2010. Britain should help lead the global response to climate change. While rejecting isolationism, the British are more reluctant to pay the cost of their ambitions, reflexively euroskeptic and increasingly hostile to foreign aid.	0
Suffolk County Executive Steve Bellone said plow operators were struggling with whiteout conditions. Snow and ice is going to be frozen in place. The streets were largely empty at the height of the storm, with workers outside hotels and apartment buildings shoveling snow and then, as more fell, shoveling again.	1
“The wave action tore everything apart.” Climate scientists say they need precise readings from storm surges if they are to predict how much those will worsen with climate change, and to specify risks to nearby coastal areas. The vulnerability of the gauges comes in part from the continuing rise of the sea, which is believed to be caused largely by human emissions of greenhouse gases. “We know our stations are at increasing risk, because the storm surges ride upon sea level,” Mr. Gill said.	0
“I don’t think our expectation was that this one proposal or any proposal could solve the nation’s air pollution problem or meet our policy goals with respect to the consumption of coal,” Mr. Billings said. Reducing carbon emissions would also reduce airborne hazards like mercury and ozone. Dr. Thurston, a spokesman for the society, said that with the new regulation, “you’re reducing the most toxic particles and ones associated with the most severe effects.” The effects on health of reducing carbon emissions, unlike those on climate, are “local and immediate, so the people who do the cleanup will get the benefits,” Dr. Thurston said.	1
This will be followed by another reinforcing shot of bitterly cold air during the latter half of the week ahead. The Arctic had the power to put the United States into a deep freeze if you read the Associated Press story published in mid-December. The magnitude and pace of the recent Arctic sea-ice decline and ocean warming is “unprecedented” in at least the past 1,500 years and likely much longer, according to a federal report released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.	1
"As for the president, in recent speeches promoting his plan to reduce global warming Obama has highlighted the progress his administration has made driving down emissions at home. Together, we've held our carbon emissions to levels not seen in about 20 years. ""Since 2006, no country on earth has reduced its total carbon pollution by as much as the United States."""	1
The purpose of these claims is obviously to frighten and befuddle the public, and to make it seem like there is evidence where, in fact, there is none. There is no real-world evidence that supports man-made global warming theory. None.	2
Schüco, one of Germany’s oldest window companies, also designs low-energy doors and facades. Countries like China and India, which rank among the top greenhouse gas emitters globally, and are plagued by worsening air pollution, have shown growing interest in sustainable, environmentally friendly buildings. The Chinese have even asked if Schüco could develop a “smoke window” capable of filtering the outside air, he said.	1
Charles and David Koch, billionaire industrialist brothers, have put millions of dollars into advocacy groups and super PACs like Americans for Prosperity, which have campaigned aggressively against lawmakers who support climate change policy. The global warming agenda is a loser for them with the American people. Mr. Phillips said that none of the four most vulnerable Democratic senators — Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, Mark Begich of Alaska, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas — had embraced climate change policy.	2
“These are high-cost resources.” He added that a spill “could be very detrimental for the reputation of a company.” After Shell’s problems, ConocoPhillips and the Norwegian oil giant Statoil suspended their Alaskan Arctic drilling plans. Global warming would open stretches of the Arctic Ocean to shipping and drilling. And the Alaskan Arctic is one of the great untapped frontiers for offshore drilling in the United States, with the potential to produce up to a million barrels a day, or more than 10 percent of current domestic production, according to industry estimates.	2
"""Future emissions will only compound the situation."" Between 1990 and 2011, carbon dioxide and other gas emissions caused a 30 percent increase in the warming effect on the climate. After carbon dioxide, methane has the biggest effect on climate."	0
By acknowledging and coming down on the right side of one of the most important moral issues in the world right now, he is bringing hope to millions of people. His visit to the United States will inspire Congress to work across the aisle toward solutions to climate change, whether through a carbon tax or through other methods that will reduce our carbon footprint fast. LINA BIRD Pasadena, Calif. To the Editor: Re “How the Pope Might Renew the Church,” by Francis A. Quinn (Op-Ed, Sept. 19): Bishop Quinn’s proposals for reform, while alluring in their boldness, are actually shortsighted.	0
That’s an amount nearly equal the 771 gigatons already in the atmosphere. The carbon released will further warm the planet. “It’s a feedback loop,” says Eugene Turner, a professor at Louisiana State University’s Coastal Ecology Institute in Baton Rouge, who attended the Brazil conference.	0
“The truth is, we don’t fully understand what’s going on,” said Ted Maksym, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Unlike the Arctic, where sharp declines in recent decades in the ice that floats on sea surfaces have been linked to warming, sea ice in the Antarctic has actually increased. Averaged over the entire Antarctic coast, the increase is slight — about 1 percent a decade.	2
The largest impact comes at night, when sunlight absorbed during the day rises from dark pavement and roof materials, and combines with heat generated by the production and use of energy. The impact of urban heat on rising global average temperatures is tiny. In a study published two years ago, for example, researchers at Stanford University estimated that globally, the urban heat-island effect represents between 2 and 4 percent of the warming that rising greenhouse gases have driven.	2
In response, environmental groups say that many industry-backed studies fudge the fact that they are talking about reductions in the future growth of GDP and income, not absolute cuts from today’s levels. Alternative-energy technologies will not advance and ignore jobs that might be created in new low-carbon industries. Furthermore, almost all studies that predict direct economic consequences ignore the costs of inaction, according to the NRDC.	1
The group’s soft, conditional goals for 2050 will be too little, too late, many environmentalists say. De-carbonization is not happening fast enough. The need for geoengineering is “almost certain,” he says.	0
In April, a group of self-described climate skeptics, led by the Heartland Institute, a libertarian group, came to Rome to protest. Fossil fuels are the moral choice for the developing world. Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo of Argentina, who is also chancellor of the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy of Sciences, has sharply rebutted the criticism and postulated that many of the attacks have been underwritten by oil companies or influenced by conservative American interests, including the Tea Party.	2

The Laptev Sea and the Bering Sea posted temperatures 7.2 degrees F above the 1981-2010 average, while the Barents Sea above Norway was close to its 1981-to-2010 average. During the past 15 years, the retreat of summer sea ice has led to a 5 percent increase in the amount of energy the Arctic Ocean has taken up. Some researchers had suggested that warming over an increasingly exposed Arctic Ocean should have led to an increase in evaporation and hence increased cloudiness in the summer.	1
They also presented a conceivable way the auto industry could evolve in the coming decades to maximize fuel efficiency in autos, and possibly one day abandon the internal combustion engine altogether. The auto industry is on the cusp of redefining its relationship with fossil fuels and is on its way to becoming more of a mainstream concept. The EIA's 2014 Annual Energy Outlook predicts that increasing fuel economy requirements will drive down Americans' consumption of gasoline to just over six million barrels of gasoline per day by the year 2040.	1
“When some people don’t have food, you get starvation. The poorest people in the world, who have had virtually nothing to do with causing global warming, will be high on the list of victims as climatic disruptions intensify. It cited a World Bank estimate that poor countries need as much as $100 billion a year to try to offset the effects of climate change; they are now getting, at best, a few billion dollars a year in such aid from rich countries.	0
But as countries consider next steps toward stemming biodiversity's decline, some conservationists say they see hope in one key difference between preserving biodiversity and, say, dealing with global warming. Dealing with global warming is more akin to buying an insurance policy. It involves accepting some level of economic sacrifice now in exchange for staving off plausible but still-uncertain effects in the future.	1
The Australia-based Climate Institute said the American goal would amount to a 41 percent reduction by 2030. This target would see us doing our bit in limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. Scientists hope that holding global warming to an increase of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit, will limit the worst effects of climate change.	0
That allows the relatively warmer waters of the Southern Ocean to flow more freely to the more permanent ice that extends from the land in glaciers and sheets. The combination of the warm ocean and the effects of waves on these glaciers may increase the rate of loss of glacial ice. The consensus now is that there is a net loss of ice from Antarctica’s ice sheets and glaciers, Dr. Maksym added, and it is the melting of this ice, rather than any loss of sea ice, that concerns scientists who study sea-level increases.	1
Droughts, famines, and diseases produced by global warming “have already killed millions of people in the Global South,” the document announces, adding that the earth is “already too hot for safety and justice.” “The global economy’s overshoot of ecological limits and, increasingly climate change, are driving a global fresh water scarcity crisis and the sixth mass extinction of species, which could devastate much of life on earth for the next ten million years,” the resolution warns. Global warming has been behind every catastrophe and uprising on the planet. Climate change “has been linked to the Syrian War, the rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria, as well as the famines, water shortages, and resulting conflict in Yemen, Somalia, and South Sudan,” the document pronounces.	0
But between them they had the necessary skillset to push their pet issue onto the world stage and embed it in global political consciousness. Interest in global warming to snowball. In 1988, thanks to their efforts, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) held its inaugural meeting.	1
Ridd is the professor who was hounded out of his job after telling the truth about the Great Barrier Reef: that it wasn’t being destroyed by “global warming.” Since this didn’t accord with the narrative being promoted by his alarmist institution he was fired on the pretext that he had “engaged in a pattern of conduct that misrepresents the nature and conduct of the disciplinary process through publi­cations online and in the media”. It is impossible to know how much global temperatures have really risen. But he estimates that of the 0.6 degrees C that the planet has warmed since 1950, perhaps one third has been exaggerated.	2
Those factors have already driven down beef consumption in the United States by 19 percent since 2005. The proposed carbon tax on beef has no chance of becoming reality. Our politicians continue to regard the beef industry as, well, a sacred cow.	1
“But relative to oil prices, it’s small.” Mr. Leach, who was part of a group that proposed climate measures to the provincial government of Alberta, estimates that they will add about $2.50 to $3 in American dollars to the price of a barrel of crude oil from Alberta’s oil sands, after adjusting for tax write-offs. Carbon pricing will jeopardize the future of Canadian industry, which generally exports most of its production to the United States. “By far, the United States is our biggest trade and investment partner, and they are also our biggest competitor,” said Ed Fast, a former cabinet minister who is now the Conservative spokesman in Parliament on climate issues.	1
This slowly unfolding scenario is set to pose wrenching choices for many in the US. About 13 million Americans may have to move due to sea level rise by the end of the century, with landlocked states such as Arizona and Wyoming set for a population surge. “My flood insurance bill just went up by $100 this year, it went up $100 the year before,” said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami.	0
Ground water and water stored in reservoirs in effect cancel each other out. By 2030, global average sea levels could rise between three and nine inches over 2000 levels, range from six inches to two feet by 2050, and from 19 to 55 inches by 2100. The IPCC's upper estimate from 2007 projects as much as a 23-inch rise by 2100.	1
The gas traps heat in the atmosphere, resulting in the gradual warming that has alarmed scientists and much of the public. But only half of the carbon dioxide stays up there. While scientists know what happens to half of that half — it dissolves into the oceans — the rest is a continuing puzzle.	2
Released enough greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to prevent another global cool down. Now, millennia later, researchers hope new farming techniques will put some of that carbon back into the ground and help stem the rising tide of global warming.	1
The World Wildlife Fund said walrus have also been gathering in large groups on the Russian side of the Chukchi Sea. The Arctic environment is changing extremely rapidly and it is time for the rest of the world to take notice and also to take action to address the root causes of climate change.

That has fallen to modelers. Climate models could indeed reproduce a hiatus in warming during the 2000s if the model used observed sea-surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific between 1970 and 2012, rather calculating its own ocean temperatures. The hiatus pointed to a multi-decade climate swing known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) as a prime suspect behind the slowdown in warming.	1
Arctic sea ice shrunk to the sixth lowest level on record in September, while Antarctic sea ice grew to a record extent for the third straight year. The concentration in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide, a key greenhouse gas, rose to a new high of 396 parts per million last year. Figures for 2014 were not yet ready.	0
Resistance can also be avoided by framing the issue differently, says Ted Nordhaus, managing partner at American Environics in Oakland, Calif., a firm that brings psychological and cognitive science to bear on social-change strategies. For example, stressing the idea that human activity is behind global warming can be counterproductive. It can provoke retrenchment and backlash.	2
Heat waves in recent years have become more intense, a consequence of global warming, he said, raising the possibility of ever-deadlier fire seasons. The overall trend over decades to more intense and more frequent heat waves is definitely a signal of global warming. The current heat in Southern California was especially unusual, he said, because some areas closer to the coasts were hotter than, or comparable to, temperatures in the inland deserts.	0
Not to beat the World War II comparisons too heavily, but the United States built 2,000 airplanes in 1939; by 1944 that had become over 96,000, at a time when naysayers doubted 50,000 was a reachable number. We can devise and build flood barriers; we can cap and control the spewing of carbon and methane into the air. It’s a matter of will, not one of magic.	1
The new study confirms previous findings that how much of the world’s ice will melt is closely linked to how much total fossil fuel humans burn. A rapid shift away from those fuels over coming decades would preserve much of the ice, or at least slow the melting drastically. On the other hand, if the use of fossil fuels were to continue rising at the same rate it rose over the past century, the estimated deposits would be burned by about the middle of the 22nd century, Dr. Caldeira said, and complete destruction of the world’s land ice would be well underway.	0
What’s not clear from the interview is why he is so convinced that climate change is such a threat. People are so addicted to their carbon fuelled lifestyles. Well, we all have beliefs, feelings, and interests.	1
Scientists agree that evidence is growing that warmer weather is having an effect on health, but they say it is only one part of an immensely complex set of forces that are influencing health. Global travel and trade, not climate change, brought the first cases of chikungunya, a mosquito-borne tropical disease, to Florida. Temperatures may be rising, but overall deaths from heat are not, in part because the march of progress has helped people adapt — air conditioning is more ubiquitous, for example, and the treatment of heart disease, a major risk for heat-related mortality, has improved.	2
They compared them with fossils from the island that date to 1,000 to 3,000 years ago, along with data from current vertebrate populations. During the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago, some 17 bird species went extinct on Abaco because of a warming, wetter climate and rising sea levels. “All of these birds were open country birds that preferred grassy, dry, cool climates,” said David Steadman, the curator of ornithology at the Florida Museum of Natural History and one of the study’s authors.	1
Global warming has not caused an increase in the frequency or intensity of hurricanes. Climate alarmists such Michael Mann, Kerry Emanuel, and Al Gore often claim that hurricanes are among the extreme weather events that have been exacerbated by man’s selfishness, greed, and refusal to amend his carbon-guzzling lifestyle.	2
"That was one of the issues before the heads of state from the 27-member European Union as they gathered in Brussels Thursday and Friday to address climate change and, in particular, the security threats it raises. Unchecked climate change could not only cause a flood of new environmental migrants to Europe. Climate change, the report says, is a ""threat multiplier"" which ""intensifies existing trends, tensions, and instability."""	0
Sorry, no. I am also old enough to remember when Climate Change was called Global Warming and then had to be re-branded because God made it snow every time Al Gore gave a speech. Those 13 items listed above are not a joke, are not sarcasm, are not an exaggeration on my part.	2
"It's recognizing that the impact is likely to be most severe in some of the most impoverished areas of the world. Doing something about climate change is loving our global neighbor. ""It's about caring about people who are already hurting around the world."	0
"""It&apos;s a big deal"" because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said lead author Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado. Even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion. ""Any flooding concerns that coastal communities have for 2100 may occur over the next few decades,"" Oregon State University coastal flooding expert Katy Serafin said in an email."	1
Today, scientists believe there are 20,000 to 25,000 polar bears, though this is still about 60 percent below historic levels. The loss of Arctic sea ice, which bears rely on for hunting and denning, is accelerating to record levels due to global warming. As a result, US Geological Survey scientists recently warned that projected changes in sea-ice conditions could lead to the loss of about two-thirds of the world's polar bear population by midcentury.	0
They offer no reason, for instance, to revise the sea-level forecast for the coming century. The rise of the sea would not likely exceed three feet in that period, and would probably be less. While some island nations may be wiped out by a rise of that magnitude, experts believe most major cities could be protected from it, though at a likely cost in the trillions of dollars.	1
He said the agency had gone astray in revising the text of the statute. The task of dealing with global warming is urgent and important. “The framers of the Constitution,” he added, “did not grant the executive branch the authority to set economic and social policy as it sees fit.” The agency said its regulation of tailpipe emissions also required regulation of emissions from stationary sources under two permitting programs.	0
Suddenly, all those millions Soros has given campaign groups to talk them down must seem like money well spent. This is especially true of the fossil fuel which for years has been vilified by eco-campaigners as the dirtiest of them all. Soros tried to position himself as an enemy of coal, stating at the 2009 Copenhagen climate change summit, “There is no magic bullet for climate change, but there is a lethal bullet: coal.” In the last quarter, however, he invested $4.7 million into Peabody Energy Corporation, the largest “pure play coal company” in the United States, according to the company’s website.	2
These are regions that get abnormally cold, and in the clashing of that very cold and very warm, it often leads to very intense storms, [like the] five or six nor’easters that impacted the eastern seaboard. Global warming creates these extreme heat events. MJ: You wrote about northern Siberia experiencing record-high temperatures.	0
The worst-case scenario would be the creation of huge zones with too little oxygen for sea creatures to survive, with unknown consequences for the overall ecology of the ocean, the panel said. The possibility that a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, believed to be especially vulnerable to a warming ocean, would greatly increase the rate of sea level rise. It found that risk, in the near term, to be “unknown but probably low.” The National Research Council is a nonprofit group in Washington that frequently oversees studies on major scientific questions; this study was commissioned by several government agencies.	0
The event highlights another factor critical to ice forecasts, notes the National Ice Center's Clemente-Colon. To get any improvement in ice forecasting, you really have to improve weather forecasting in the Arctic. Among other things, that means more weather sensors in a sensor-starved part of the world.	1
“Sorry to see him go but expect he will be snatched up soon by another team.” On a more serious note, Mr. Obama used the chat, conducted from the hurricane center, to paint a dire picture of the consequences of climate change. More severe weather events lead to displacement, scarcity, stressed populations; all increase likelihood of global conflict. Mr. Obama is no stranger to Miami, having already visited twice this year.	0
He also backs a new tax on carbon emissions, though his motivation is environmental rather than budgetary; he would return tax proceeds to businesses through lower corporate rates and to individuals through tax rebates and other benefits. The carbon tax faces a steep uphill fight, even as climate change assumes a larger role on the political stage. Nor is there much prospect of massive increases in marginal tax rates, though Thomas Piketty, the French economist whose recent book accelerated the income inequality debate, argues that top rates could reach 80 percent without harming the economy.	1
“We, as a country, we are petroholics,” said Thomas Nilsen, who runs a news site called The Independent Barents Observer. Climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels. At the same time, we depend so much on the income from the oil.	0
And smaller herring could mean that feeding tuna have to work harder for each meal. Changing oceanic conditions driven, perhaps, by global warming, may be responsible for the tuna's woes. Warmer temperatures explain the abundance of young tuna in the Gulf of Maine.	0
She’s a program director at Texas Campaign for the Environment and assessed the impact of pollution across Houston. West Houston is becoming increasingly vulnerable to climate change, in the form of freak storms and floods. It has suffered extensive flooding from Harvey and at least two other storms in the past five years.	0
She spends her days collecting cow dung for fuel and struggling to grow vegetables in soil poisoned by salt water. This area will be inundated as sea levels rise and storm surges increase, and a cyclone or another disaster could easily wipe away her rebuilt life. But Ms. Khatun is trying to hold out at least for a while — one of millions living on borrowed time in this vast landscape of river islands, bamboo huts, heartbreaking choices and impossible hopes.	1
I’ve just been reading two new reports on the economics of fighting climate change: a big study by a blue-ribbon international group, the New Climate Economy Project, and a working paper from the International Monetary Fund. Strong measures to limit carbon emissions would have hardly any negative effect on economic growth, and might actually lead to faster growth. This may sound too good to be true, but it isn’t.	1
"If both types of aerosols declined, the net effect likely would be warming. Reducing black-carbon soot would have a net cooling effect. ""This is geoengineering made in heaven,"" he says, referring to proposals to moderate global warming by injecting cooling aerosols into the atmosphere."	1
Widespread deforestation for agriculture and urban development has also spurred the release of greenhouse gases, causing the planet to warm by around 1 C over the past century. The world has little over a decade to drastically reduce emissions or face increasingly severe storms, drought, heatwaves, coastal flooding, and food insecurity. The revegetation of the Americas after European arrival aided declines of global carbon content in the air, dropping by around seven to 10 parts of carbon dioxide for every million molecules of air in the atmosphere.	0
The research concluded that the birds were likely downsizing because smaller bodies shed heat faster than larger ones. Global warming is likely to be causing the changes. She said she suspected that other Australian birds beyond the species studied were also shrinking and the trend will accelerate in the future as a result of global climate change.	1
Of these, two-thirds also believe this warming is caused by human activities – though there is a deep partisan divide on the issue. Even so, global warming ranked second to last on a list of 20 priorities for the president and Congress this year. And Americans are far less concerned about the issue than people in other countries.	1
Those could include adding compost on rangelands or seeding fields between harvests with so-called cover crops such as grasses and mustards, which add organic matter to the soil. Such measures could eliminate from the air the equivalent of millions of tons of carbon dioxide a year. For now, the soils initiative is funded with just $7.5 million, a drop in the bucket for a state with more than 76,000 farms.	1
"He estimates that fires are burning in at least 20 nations, but notes that researchers have little understanding of their environmental damage and the scope of their impact on human health. The truth is, we don't really have a good regional or global estimate of emissions from these fires. ""It's quite possible the emissions from these fires should be a significant part of the climate change models."	1
Peter Erickson, a senior scientist with the Stockholm Environment Institute, a research organization, found that emissions from Norway’s oil exports this year will be 10 times as much as Norway’s domestic carbon emissions. Norway should curb the supply of fossil fuels, rather than just trimming demand among its own people. “Norway has set out to be a global leader in climate action, yet continued expansion of oil and gas production could eclipse the benefits of Norway’s domestic emission reduction efforts,” Mr. Erickson and his colleague Adrian Down wrote in a recent paper.	0
He attributes California’s water crisis not to weather, but to interference by the federal government. Global warming is nonsense. He criticized the federal government for shutting off portions of California’s system of water irrigation and storage, and diverting water into a program for freshwater salmon.	2
With this latest global bleaching in its third year, reef scientists say they have no doubt as to the responsible party. The coral reefs would be at risk if human society kept burning fossil fuels at a runaway pace, releasing greenhouse gases that warm the ocean. Emissions continued to rise, and now the background ocean temperature is high enough that any temporary spike poses a critical risk to reefs.	0
Energy companies, in turn, have campaigned aggressively to lift the ban on crude oil exports that was imposed after the crippling 1973 Arab oil embargo. Climate changes caused by the burning of fossil fuels have begun to harm the global economy. Mr. Obama has proposed a series of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on power plants and cars in an effort to curb greenhouse gas pollution, but Republicans have said the rules would force employers to eliminate jobs.	0
GWYNETH CRAVENS East Hampton, N.Y. From a climate perspective, the smart strategy is to hold on to nuclear plants until their power can be replaced with carbon-free electricity. That’s why it’s worth paying attention to the recent landmark agreement between Pacific Gas and Electric, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Friends of the Earth and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.	1
"When popularizers like Bill Nye brush off critiques with unscientific claims that human beings cause ""one hundred percent"" of climate change, it's time to rethink the underlying claims of the movement. Carbon emissions have some effect on the atmosphere. Even if the global warming theory were completely proven, desperate efforts like the Green New Deal — which Klobuchar foolishly endorsed — would do extremely little to stem the tide of climate change."	1
“We might be witnessing the birth of a new system, without quite realizing it,” said Glen P. Peters, a climate researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo. A market mechanism can reach more deeply into the economy than any other approach, changing the behavior even of people and companies that might not necessarily care about global warming. The Wisconsin dairymen perhaps serve as an example of that.	1
Going green is a way to address a long-term threat, not just save money. Natural ice conditions are diminishing across the globe, particularly in Canada. “As we look at the future of the game, it’s about getting more kids involved and creating a long glide path.”	1
Nevertheless, many environmentalists disagree, and are disappointed at having to reopen a battle they thought was won long ago. It is most crucial to combat global warming. Environment America, a federation of green groups, stated in a recent report that energy efficiency and renewable sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal can do the job faster and cheaper.	0
The other item to note from the above exercise is that in every case, the returns were positive across both administrations -- during a period that saw oil prices swing between the $30's to nearly $150/bbl.

Many Republican candidates question the science of climate change or do not publicly address the issue. Policies designed to curb global warming would hurt the economy. Although the poll found that climate change was not a top issue in determining a person’s vote, a candidate’s position on climate change influences how a person will vote.	2
He’s probably the world’s greatest professor of atmospheric physics. The whole global warming thing is a scam. The flaws in the alarmist position Lindzen exposed in 1992 remain the same today: the global warming scare story depends on hopelessly inadequate computer models which place too much emphasis on man-made CO2 and which therefore produce a “disturbingly arbitrary” picture of the state of climate.	2
According to Grist‘s own Eric Holthaus, who’s been writing about climate change for more than a decade, it’s not. Whatever it takes to decarbonize the global economy rapidly. So Grist asked the two climate writers to discuss telling stories about the end of the world, facing their climate fears, and finding a sliver of hope in the face of studies detailing the melting of Antarctic ice.	0
"""It's never surprising to see a record-high temperature set these days,"" Professor Zaitchik says. We are seeing a long-term global warming trend. Last month was the 38th consecutive June that surpassed 20th-century averages, and global temperatures have not dipped below last century’s average since February 1985."	0
Australia, at least, has not pulled out of the Paris agreement — though America’s withdrawal is cited by Australian conservatives as an argument against setting emissions targets — and it remains committed to reduce energy emission levels in 2030 to 26 percent below those of 2005. Steps should be taken against global warming even if they are costly. Ideology and idiocy, of course, are not limited to climate policy or to any country.	0
Climate change seemed like a godsend for Kiribati, the Pacific island nation threatened by rising seas. The result of that promise was the Green Climate Fund.	1
On Twitter and other social media sites, they pointed out that a group whose journey was meant to highlight the effects of global warming was trapped by a substance that was supposed to be melting. Global warming idiots out of danger. The episode had little connection to climate change — shifting winds had caused loose pack ice to jam against the ship — and this was far from the first time that a ship had been trapped, even in the Antarctic summer.	2
Yes, you read that correctly. The explanation lies with global warming. That is certainly not the popular impression.	1
In Michigan, where concern is rising over the impact of climate change on the Great Lakes, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, Representative Gary Peters, is challenging his Republican opponent, Terri Lynn Land, to say whether she believes human activity causes global warming. The leader of a company that disputes a threat from global warming has no place at an institution where scientists have underscored the seriousness of the problem and administrators. The university says Mr. Boyce of Peabody Energy is staying on its board — and the students say they will keep protesting until that changes.	0
More broadly, scientists tracking long-term changes in greenhouse-gas emissions found two years ago that between 2000 and 2005, emissions rose four times faster than they had during the previous 10 years. During this century, half of the energy the world needs will come from fossil fuels. Meanwhile, buried in the footnotes of a broad negotiating road map that came out of the global climate talks in Bali last December, lie references to an emissions objective around which many countries hope to frame talks.	1
For comparison, sea-surface temperatures have gone up 1.5 degrees F (0.8 degrees C) since 1901, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data. Climate scientists centuries in the future won&apost be able to see any hints of the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age in Pacific data. Nevertheless, the findings are important for today.	2
The scale of this climatic shift may completely change the culture of the Arctic. Global warming impacts are far from monolithic. But the overall trend is clear: It’s getting warmer, and winter is losing its intensity and duration.	2
"This is not a surprise to us,"" said climate scientist Mark Serreze, director of the NSIDC. Well, everything is OK because the big changes in the Arctic are essentially balanced by what's happening in the Antarctic. This is simply not true."""	2
(The area where the research ship became stuck, west of the Ross Sea, has had a slight increase in ice cover over the past 35 years.) The changes in those seas are related to north-south winds that circulate clockwise around a stationary zone of increasingly lower-pressure air. That brings warmer air from the north into the Bellingshausen Sea and peninsula, pushing ice against the coast and melting some of it, and colder air from the south into the Ross Sea, which spreads the ice away from the coast and creates more of it.	1
Last week in the journal Nature, scientists look back at the eruptions of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 and Mexico’s El Chichón in 1982 to give us a glimpse at how geoengineering might affect another critical global system: agriculture. The technique would bring down soaring global temperatures, which would help avoid heat-stressing crops. Bad news is, the solar shading that would come with geoengineering would negatively affect crops, likely wiping out the gains from lower temperatures.	1
“That made me open it rather than throw it out.” The cover letter inside, however, made the book’s premise clear. Well over 90 percent of published climate scientists have concluded that recent global warming is both real and mostly the result of human activity. For example, a study in 2010 found that 97 percent of the 200 most-published authors of climate-related papers held the consensus position, and a survey in 2013 of 4,014 abstracts of peer-reviewed climate papers found 97 percent agreement.	0
It was the numbers – in her case, the nonfinancial ones – that made the case for Ms. Kurth, president of a family environmental-education foundation. A safe level of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide is 350 parts per million. In May, the number hit 400 p.p.m.	1
Renewable energy is attractive to companies like HP not just because green initiatives are good publicity or make for happier shareholders who are concerned about acting on climate change. Energy sources like wind and solar are not as vulnerable to market fluctuations as fossil fuels are. Once a company buys into renewable energy, the cost of paying for the utility over time is lower.	1
As the president unveiled new rules that seek to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from US power plants, we’re reminded of the dramatic progress we’ve already made as a nation in recent years. No nation has reduced carbon emissions more over the past eight years than the US. The not-so-secret weapon in America’s arsenal?	1
As the authors of the paper have argued in response to the coverage, implying otherwise is the same as giving up just as the fight gets tough. A domino effect will kick in if global temperatures rise. The Guardian: A domino-like cascade of melting ice, warming seas, shifting currents and dying forests could tilt the Earth into a “hothouse” state beyond which human efforts to reduce emissions will be increasingly futile.	0
Where is the new optimism about climate change and growth coming from? A well-thought-out strategy of emissions control, in particular one that puts a price on carbon via either an emissions tax or a cap-and-trade scheme, would cost much less than the usual suspects want you to think. But the economics of climate protection look even better now than they did a few years ago.	1
They have nearly doubled, to $4 a ton, and the revisions are expected to spur still more clean-energy investment. In the long run, carbon markets will make a substantial contribution only if they can be tied together across political boundaries. That would allow polluters to search the world for the cheapest ways of cutting emissions.	1
They have been trying off and on since Kyoto was agreed in 1997 to widen limits on emissions but have been unable to find a formula acceptable to both rich and poor nations. The main responsibility to cut emissions lies with developed nations, which had a headstart in sparking global warming. Combating climate change also poses a challenge for the poverty-fighting World Bank: how to balance global warming with immediate energy needs in poor countries.	0
Another risk, judged to be moderately likely over the coming century, is that rising heat in the upper ocean could result in reduced oxygen in the deep. The worst-case scenario would be the creation of huge zones with too little oxygen for sea creatures to survive, with unknown consequences for the overall ecology of the ocean. It considered the possibility that a collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, believed to be especially vulnerable to a warming ocean, would greatly increase the rate of sea level rise.	0
The new figures were released late Monday by the Global Carbon Project, which tracks emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels and the production of cement rose by 2.1 percent in 2012, compared with 2011, and they are projected to rise by a similar amount in 2013. Since 2000, growth in such emissions had been running above 3 percent a year, on average.	1
Opposition to the carbon tax trailed away after Ms. Gillard’s ouster, and public concern about climate change has only grown. There should be carbon pricing for major emitters. We did, after all, elect a government that promised to ax it.	0
Allowing them to be traded would give carbon reserves tangible value that could be sold for real money, which could be used to protect these biologically diverse forests. Saving a tropical forest of, say, a million acres would prevent roughly 367 million tons of carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere, where some of it would remain for thousands of years. In our pilot project, a major corporation has agreed to buy one million offset credits over 20 years.	0
Email us at ourpicks@nytimes.com. The Democrats have won when it comes to emphasizing the importance of fighting global warming. Where they’ve lost, he argues, is actual policy proposals that are palatable to the American people.	1
It includes a needlessly long wish list of progressive economic policies, including “economic security for all people” and the counteracting of “systemic injustices.” “The operating principle behind the Green New Deal is a no-enemies-to-the-left spirit of fostering unity among every faction of the progressive movement,” Jonathan Chait writes in New York magazine. Thus, at the same time, the plan avoids taking stances that are absolutely vital to reduce carbon emissions. But it’s not.	1
All this is progress, but the prospects for the rest of the century remain grim. The global conservation movement is like a surgeon in an emergency room treating an accident victim. Congratulations, we might say — even though the patient will be dead by morning.	2
Rodale researchers say stacking no-till farming, organic farming, and composting has the potential to sequester 3,000 pounds of carbon per acre per year, ten times the amount typically achieved through no-till farming alone. Agriculture can help fight global warming. “Can it help mitigate?	0
“The fight we’re doing here, it bears on what happens elsewhere — we’re all in this together, we feel like.” The movement extends well beyond the United States. Climate change can be blunted only by moving to renewable energy and capping any growth of fossil fuels. Speaking to the crowd at Seneca Lake, Mr. McKibben, who had come from his home in Vermont, said, “Our job on behalf of the planet is to slow them down.” He added, “If we can hold them off for two or three years, there’s no way any of this stuff can be built again.” But the issues are not so clear cut.	0
“That made me open it rather than throw it out.” The cover letter inside, however, made the book’s premise clear. Recent global warming is both real and mostly the result of human activity.

Climate change activists said they expected to see Trump administration officials championing fossil fuels at the climate conference, an unwelcome position among the thousands of delegates and observers who say the world must move away from polluting sources of energy. The presence of Mr. Pruitt, who says he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to global warming, would be particularly provocative. “The message would be, ‘We don’t care.’ The world would see an E.P.A.	1
Boufadel says the study points out the susceptibility of beaches worldwide to long-term oil contamination, especially at higher latitudes where beaches tend to be gravel or a mixture of sand and gravel. As global warming is melting the ice cover and exposing the Arctic to oil exploitation and shipping through sea routes such as the Northwest Passage, the risk of oil spills on gravel beaches in high-latitude regions will be increased. Boufadel and his team dug about 70 pits between 3-feet and 5-feet deep on six beaches during summers from 2007 to 2009.	0
The idea, says Jonathan Jarvis, regional director, Pacific West Region of the National Park Service, is that the parks may serve as the proverbial “canaries in the coal mine” – predictors of things to come for other populations and ecosystems. As a result of climate change, national parks are seeing extended fire seasons, species migration, and increased snow melt. Researchers and park officers outlined some of their concerns this week to a congressional subcommittee at a special hearing on the “Impacts of Climate Change on America’s National Parks” here in Twentynine Palms, Calif. M. Rebecca Shaw, director of conservation for the Nature Conservancy of California, told the panel, “An explosion of studies in the last five years has documented observed climate impacts on species distributions, wildfire frequency and intensity, pest outbreaks, and sea-level rise.” “Keeping wildlife populations, rivers, forests, deserts, and our national parks healthy will allow us to support nearly 6.5 million existing jobs and continue to generate $88 billion in state and national tax revenue,” Cipra told the panel, pointing to a 2006 study by the Outdoor Industry Association, which found that fishing, hunting, hiking, and other outdoor pursuits contribute $730 billion annually to the US economy.	0
"The researchers said current water policies have not translated to significant reductions in use of the groundwater - people are simply pumping until wells run dry. Balancing the water needs of the present with the long-term needs of the future is a global concern. ""Although consumption of freshwater supplies has not yet crossed a potentially dangerous planetary threshold, crop yields have begun to fall in many regions because of water scarcity, and global food security remains a worldwide concern,"" the report said."	0
What kind of shape do you think Miami – or for that matter, New York – is likely to be in after 80 feet of sea-level rise? The single biggest uncertainty in climate science has nothing to do with the physics of the atmosphere, or the stability of the ice, or anything like that. The great uncertainty is, and has always been, how much carbon pollution humans are going to choose to pump into the air.	1
"While cranberry hybrid development has thus far been focused on improving fruit yield, nutrition, and color, Carolyn DeMoranville, director of the UMass Cranberry Station, says more attention will need to be put on developing disease- and drought-resistant types. These solutions may not help with global warming's long-term effects. But presuming that somebody decides to finally start doing something about climate change, then I think we would still have the tools ... to deal with the amount of change that's predicted in the less-drastic models."""	0
The effects of ice ages in the Northern Hemisphere are more extensive because it is “land-dominated, with lots of continents, whereas the south is mostly ocean,” Dr. Schaefer said. The rhythm of ice ages parallels changes in the solar energy that heats the continents. The last ice age peaked about 20,000 years ago, when solar radiation in the north was at a minimum because of complex factors related to Earth’s orbit.	1
At the meeting, the United States assumed the rotating two-year chairmanship of the Arctic Council, whose other members are Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden as well as six indigenous groups of the far north. Protecting the delicate Arctic environment from the consequences of climate change will be a top American priority over the next two years. As important a task will be to prevent the clash with Russia over Ukraine from undermining the cooperation on which the council has operated for the past 20 years.	0
Mr. Gore, well known for his work on global warming, said the issues of coal pollution and climate change were linked. Both are necessary byproducts of our addiction to fossil fuels. The two men visited Belews Creek, a predominantly black community in a predominantly white county that resides in the shadow of the Belews Creek Steam Station, a coal-fired power plant.	1
But with his foray into SSTs, he risks sullying his reputation. We can emit only so much carbon dioxide and still remain within the temperature limit set by the Paris accord. New supersonic aircraft will help devour that carbon budget faster than ever.	1
The data set covered six years and more than 12,000 individual wells. Rising fossil fuel emissions, which increase the temperature of the planet, pose grave risks to water supplies. Water levels in 21 of the world’s 47 largest known aquifers are trending negative, according to a 2015 study published by a group of NASA scientists in the journal Water Resources Research.	0
“At 26 to 28 percent, Australia’s target gets the right balance between our economic and environmental responsibilities,” Mr. Abbott said Tuesday after meeting with lawmakers. We are committed to tackling climate change without a carbon tax or an emissions-trading scheme that will hike up power bills for families, pensioners and businesses. Mr. Abbott has told Australian voters that measures like a pollution tax or a carbon-trading program would result in higher electricity prices and reduced economic growth.	0
Tardiness in submitting the two reports — one is required every two years under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty signed by President George Bush; the other every four years — is not unheard-of. The missed deadline underscores the disdain with which the Trump administration views the worldwide effort to rein in global warming. They also argue it undermines the United States’ push for transparency in countries like China.	0
Despite decades of deforestation and environmental damage, a recent study published in Nature Climate Change found that, lately, the Earth has been getting a bit greener. Between 2003 and 2012, the amount of vegetation above ground increased by 4 billion metric tons of carbon. The new vegetation was mapped over a period of two decades using a method called passive microwave remote sensing, in which satellites measure radiofrequency radiation emitted from the Earth.	1
The study implies that even that goal would be too warm for winter snows to make up for summer melt for one of the planet's two major land-topping ice sheets. The rate of ice loss expected for warming of 1.6 degrees is slow, occurring over 50,000 years. Higher climate-change temperatures would accelerate the process.	2
But the other half, they argued, could be accounted for only by a large increase in vegetation caused by the effects of colonization. The deaths caused by colonization led to a drop of about 3.5 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. That finding can be instructive, Ms. Perren said.	1
“Few people understand the stakes better than our Pacific Island leaders, because they’re already seeing the impact,” Mr. Obama said at the East-West Center, an education and research organization in Honolulu. Rising seas had driven villagers from their homes in Fiji and led Kiribati to buy property elsewhere for the day when that country vanishes beneath the waves. Mr. Obama repeated his criticism of those who deny the science of climate change.	1
And as Trump was pulling the United States out of the agreement last June, Kim described Trump’s decision as “the height of egotism.’ Yes. The secret of being green is to have zero economic growth: no manufacturing no pesky carbon emissions. This is why, during Earth Hour, when the world’s nations turn off their lights for an hour in sympathy with Gaia, the hands down winner every time is North Korea.	2
Mr. Luchsinger, retired and living in New Hampshire, said the issue with historic sites was not just finding the money to make them more resilient, but also slowing the emissions that are putting them at risk in the first place. To turn a blind eye on how sea-level rise and climate change are going to affect preserving our history is just, to me, unacceptable. “That’s where we come from.	0
Whatever the explanation, much of the Bellingshausen is now ice free for long periods each summer. The relatively warmer waters of the Southern Ocean to flow more freely to the more permanent ice that extends from the land in glaciers and sheets. “The combination of the warm ocean and the effects of waves on these glaciers may increase the rate of loss of glacial ice,” Dr. Maksym said.	1
"By looking at all these types of measurements together, the study authors could more confidently set aside data that did not represent ice cover, Shepherd explained. The satellite measurements tell us that the ice sheet is much more dynamic than we used to think. ""If you take a look at the first IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] assessment report — 30 years ago, before we had satellite measurements of the polar regions — you&apos;ll see that the ice sheets were not expected to respond to climate change at all."	1
The scientists wrote that “outsourcing production to China does not always relieve consumers in the United States — or for that matter many countries in the Northern Hemisphere — from the environmental impacts of air pollution.” The movement of air pollutants associated with the production of goods in China for the American market has resulted in a decline in air quality in the Western United States, the scientists wrote, though less manufacturing in the United States does mean cleaner air in the American East. He and the other scientists wanted to examine the transborder effects of emissions from export industries to look at how consumption contributes to global air pollution. “We’re focusing on the trade impact,” said Mr. Lin, a professor in the department of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at Peking University’s School of Physics.	1
Pretty soon, though, it shows its true colors: Rebekah Mercer and the Mercer Family Foundation, political kingmakers and the financiers behind Breitbart News, are major funders of climate science denial projects such as the Heartland Institute, where they have donated nearly $6 million since 2008. An increase in C02 emissions from fossil fuels will be a great benefit to plant and animal life on Earth. Yup.	2
Higher seas and warmer weather will cause profound changes. Widespread burning of fossil fuels is releasing heat-trapping gases that are warming the planet. While this will produce a host of effects, the most worrisome may be the melting of much of the earth’s ice, which is likely to raise sea levels and flood coastal regions.	0
"Add global warming to the mix, and the annual damage estimate from tropical cyclones could rise by another $53 billion. No single storm can be laid at the foot of global warming. But the typhoon Haiyan disaster should serve as a wake-up call, according to the Philippines climate negotiator Naderev Saño: ""I speak for my delegation, but I speak for the countless people who will no longer be able to speak for themselves after perishing from the storm."	2
Gavin A. Schmidt, the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA, said that in some ways, modern civilization had not advanced much in its coping mechanisms for climate crises. If the sea is rising, you either get out of the way, or you get flooded. But, he added, modern humans possess much better predictive power and are therefore “the first generation who is able to take mitigation seriously.” Yet many countries are still behind on goals set as part of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.	1
In July, the world's oceans were the warmest in almost 130 years of record-keeping. A combination of factors are at work, including a natural El Nino system, man-made global warming and a dash of random weather. Coinciding with the shrinking of sea ice on the North Pole and the thawing of the Arctic permafrost, the discovery of Greenland's runaway glaciers earlier this decade raised a sense of urgency among scientists studying the impact of climate change on the frozen north.	2
"""Yet, if you plot the global temperature, you see a flattening average over the last 15 years. Carbon dioxide is causing the general rise of global temperatures.

“I’m more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5-degree temperature rise.” “The climate crisis is a race against time for the survival of our civilization,” he added. While many people already face the dire consequences of the climate crisis, the reality of an environment that is becoming uninhabitable is still not obvious to everyone. “But we can still reverse the trends.	0
"While many liberal outlets rushed to blame climate change for the Syrian Civil War, Syrian-American M. Zuhdi Jasser, founder and president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, powerfully shot down that idea in a 2017 interview with PJ Media. Anyone who believes that climate change had anything to do with any of the conflict in Syria is a fool. He insisted that boiling the war down to a drought ostensibly caused by carbon emissions would be ""a disservice to every life lost in Syria."""	2
Technology is turning armed conflict into an endeavor increasingly dominated by what war scholars call “asymmetric warfare” — meaning that weaker powers like Iran can now marshal so much strength that they are no longer very weak, exacting a mighty cost of victory even to the world’s pre-eminent global superpower. Then there is climate change, which has ratcheted up the opportunity cost of every conflict. You may debate whether any particular historical war worked out well for its agitators.	2
It also produces methane, a fast-acting greenhouse gas with enormous short-term impacts on the climate. The world needs to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, and must eliminate them by 2050 to limit warming to relatively safe levels. To do that, the United States would need to phase out all fossil fuels, including gas, as rapidly as possible.	0
Environmental concerns such as rising sea levels are contributing decisively to international armed conflicts and must be addressed with urgency. The Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the U.N., Archbishop Bernardito Auza, cited reports making the remarkable claim that “in the last 60 years, at least forty percent of all inter-state conflicts can be associated with natural resources.” “Not only that exploitation of high-value resources — like timber and precious minerals, or scarce ones like fertile land and water — provoke conflicts,” the archbishop said, but “conflicts, in turn, put immense pressure on those treasured natural resources, as they are exploited as means in waging conflicts.” “In other words, we fight over the ever-more scarce resources of our planet, and exploit the same resources to continue our fights,” he said.	0

Is really led by grown-up global warming zealots. The court, one that has been reliably liberal before President Donald Trump became president with the power to appoint judges, did express reluctance, but cited the separation of powers’ role in the ruling: We reluctantly conclude, however, that the plaintiffs’ case must be made to the political branches or to the electorate at large, the latter of which can change the composition of the political branches through the ballot box.	2
"This upcoming winter may be warmer overall, but government forecasters are advising that there may be some ""large swings"" due to volatile weather patterns. Warmer-than-average temperatures are forecast for much of the U.S. this winter, with a wetter-than-normal season from December through February across the northern parts of the country. ""No part of the U.S. is favored to have below-average temperatures this winter,"" according to the outlook."	1

The victims of climate change are primarily people who have done little to cause the crisis. Cyclones, floods and fires are now displacing three times as many people as wars. Not all the victims of climate change are humans.	1
The president of the European Union’s executive says the bloc’s move toward a climate neutral continent by 2050 will force its trading partners to put in extra effort if they want to do business with the EU. There is no point in only reducing greenhouse gas emissions at home, if we increase the import of CO2 from abroad. It is not only a climate issue; it is also an issue of fairness.” Von der Leyen wants to avoid a situation where EU countries reduce emissions as part of their ambition to make the continent carbon neutral by 2050, but at the same time import CO2 imbedded in goods.	0
Among these, the researchers said, were the collapse of at least part of the West Antarctic ice sheet — which itself could eventually raise sea levels by four feet or more — or the loss of the Amazon rainforest. In our view, the consideration of tipping points helps to define that we are in a climate emergency. The societal toll is accelerating, too, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said in Madrid before the opening this week of the U.N.’s annual climate conference.	0
When Trump’s tax cuts didn’t kill me like the Dems said they would, I began feeling almost immortal. I only pay attention to my health because I want to live a very long time just so I can keep pointing out that the climate has yet to murder me.

Central banks spent much of the last 10 years hauling their economies out of a deep financial crisis that began in 2008. They may well spend the next decade coping with the disruptive effects of climate change and technology. The European Central Bank, which on Thursday concluded a two-day meeting in Frankfurt focusing on monetary policy, is beginning to grapple with those challenges.	0
In the journal PLOS Biology, researchers examined the consequences of this incident by comparing the more extreme year to the previous two decades. The Arctic is changing. Although the impact of longer-term change is well-documented, researchers know much less about how climate variability and extreme weather events affect the Arctic.	1
Dust and oxygen isotopes encased in the cores provided a detailed climate record going back eons. There had been 25 rapid climate change events like the Younger Dryas in the last glacial period. The evidence in those ice cores would prove pivotal in turning the conventional wisdom.	1
And, of course, an Arctic blast can still occur in a warmer world, even if the air that comes down from the north is not as cold. Climate change could actually make frigid waves of Arctic air more common, a result of shrinking sea ice. Unlike in the rest of the country, above-average temperatures were expected across the West into the Great Basin and Rockies.	0
It has also impeded research around human-caused climate change, which President Trump has dismissed despite a global scientific consensus. But the erosion of science reaches well beyond the environment and climate. In Washington, D.C., a scientific committee that provided expertise in defending against invasive insects has been disbanded.	2
“Before we had three cycles of spraying. No single epidemic can be attributed wholly to climate change. “In general, climate change is one of the multitude of factors affecting dengue,” said Rachel Lowe, an associate professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who researches the connection between climate and the spread of diseases.	2
Why? Because the temperatures of the Earth are increasing. Attenborough’s hysterical witterings are the first salvo in what promises to be a total blitzkrieg of climate bedwetting, including Our Planet Matters — a “year-long series of special and coverage on climate change.” These include a new monthly Climate Check video feature from BBC Weather, and coverage of debates and events around the globe.	1

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), charged with considering only human causes of warming, say that humans add H2O, but the amount is so small relative to the atmospheric total that they don’t consider it significant. A 2 percent variation in H2O equals any climate change effect of human-produced CO2, or indeed all CH4, whether from natural or human sources. Our inability to solve all problems requires that policymakers create a priorities list.	1
In contrast, almost 90 percent of the seats held by House Republicans who did not belong to the caucus remained Republican after the election. Republicans need to appeal to young people who support the climate scare. Marc Morano, publisher of the influential Washington DC-based Climatedepot.com, responded, “I can’t imagine that any millennial who cares about this is going to be voting Republican because they are activists at their core.	2
This prediction comes from The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its 2018 UN Special Report on Global warming of 1.5ºC. This is the same body that used altered climate data in order to push their own agenda. The Paris Climate Agreement was seen as the latest global effort to do something about climate change.	1
Nonetheless, Maine has seen record lobster harvests in recent years, Gray notes, at “132 million pounds of lobster landings in 2016 as opposed to 57 million pounds of lobster in 2000,” though she insists that “Maine’s boom is not likely to last.” As interesting as Ms. Gray’s findings and predictions are, she fails to establish a causal relationship between manmade global warming and the meteorological phenomena she cites. Temperatures in the Antarctic Peninsula had been falling steadily for the last 18 years at the rate of nearly one degree Fahrenheit per decade, countering earlier warming trends and completely undermining one of the most cited cases of rapid climate change. Writing in Nature, the scientists acknowledged that what was once considered one of the most remarkable cases of accelerated anthropogenic climate warming was not due to human causes at all but rather to natural climate swings.	2

Scientists have made clear that we now have less than 11 years to reduce fossil fuel and other greenhouse gas emissions roughly by half, and 20 years after that to cut them to net zero, to stabilize the rise in temperatures by the end of the century and meet the goal of the Paris agreement on climate change. We are the last generation that can prevent an unthinkable global catastrophe. There are many things we can all do.	0
"""It would require the court to substitute its judgment for that of Congress and the Administration on an unprecedented scale.""

The Geneva-based panel, which monitors states' compliance with the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, concluded that although the deportation was legal, similar cases might in future justify asylum claims.

Hotter temperatures means drier vegetation, making it more likely to burn.

In logged areas of the boreal forest, trees are replanted and allowed to regenerate, and the country boasts a very low official deforestation rate of just 0.02 percent (though that has been disputed by some environmental groups). The bad news is, even if actual deforestation is low, planting a young tree to replace a mature one is not the one-for-one carbon scenario many people imagine. For a long time, scientists believed older trees stopped absorbing carbon as they aged.	1
It is literally burning,” he says, before suggesting that it is time to vote in woke leaders who embrace the dogmas of the climate crisis.

The project — to which Mr. Bloomberg has pledged $500 million — follows the same model as the Beyond Coal campaign that he and the Sierra Club started in 2011, which he says contributed to the closing of more than half of the country’s coal-fired power plants. The solution to climate change might not come through government action. The Green New Deal “stands no chance of passage in the Senate over the next two years,” he wrote, “but Mother Nature does not wait on our political calendar, and neither can we.” On taxes, health care and other economic issues, Mr. Bloomberg would be very much on the conservative end of the Democratic field.	1

Climate change spending has been the biggest waste of taxpayer money in 2019.

Add to this a worldview that equates rationality with dispassion and it makes scientists leery of dramatic claims, even when the evidence points in their direction. Climate change has been driven by runaway human consumption, much of which is based on want (comfort, convenience, entertainment), not need.

An irreversible collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet had already begun, and computer modeling in 2016 indicated that its disintegration in concert with other melting could raise sea levels up to six feet by 2100, about twice the increase described as a possible worst-case scenario just three years earlier. At that pace, some of the world’s great coastal cities, including New York, London and Hong Kong, would become inundated.	0
"The second (the second figure below), which extends over the Savanah, results in a global temperature anomaly of 0.92°C. Statistically induced warming is not real. As if that were not enough to dismiss the whole ""warmest month ever"" arguments, a quick look at the temperature data on the NOAA web site tells us that none of their grand announcements make any sense."	2
Readings of 100 and above are considered “poor.” “All of this is connected,” Mr. Narramore said. The heat wave could bring temperatures never before seen in Australia. The highest temperature ever recorded in the country was 123 degrees on Jan. 2, 1960, in Oodnadatta, a remote outback town in South Australia.	0
All the battery storage in the world, right now, can power New York City for one hour.” Pick highlighted the left-wing ideological foundation of the “climate change” narrative. Climate change policy is about raising capital, two trillion dollars in capital. “It’s going to move around and be redistributed under a climate change plan.	1
The winter months will still see significant Santa Ana activity. Precipitation patterns in California will shift with warming. So a strong Santa Ana might occur in a relatively dry December, leading to wildfires.	0
Now, ice hockey players are jumping on the “Save the Planet” bandwagon. The frightening speed of climate change is particularly visible in the Arctic. “The world today is very fragile and it’s our duty to do everything to unite people and nations to remind them that we don’t have a planet B,” Fetisov said.	0
If all those fossil fuels were ultimately extracted and burned, the report found, countries would collectively miss their climate pledges, as well as the global 2 degree Celsius target, by an even larger margin than previously thought. A number of countries around the world, including Canada and Norway, have made plans to reduce emissions at home while expanding fossil-fuel production for sale abroad. “At a global level, it doesn’t add up,” said Michael Lazarus, a lead author of the report and director of the Stockholm Environment Institute’s United States Center.	1
“We are going to produce wine where it was not possible before,” Mr. Moesgaard said. No one can say they are happy about climate change. “But we should take advantage of the opportunities it brings.”	0
Michael Wara, director of the climate and energy policy program at Stanford University, says the extreme winds that are knocking down power lines and starting fires are only one factor. The conditions that we are observing right now are a function of climate change and climate change will get worse. California has contended for over a century with an annual wildfire season.	0
Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world. Abrupt climate change could bring the planet to the edge of anarchy as countries develop a nuclear threat to defend and secure dwindling food, water and energy supplies. The threat to global stability vastly eclipses that of terrorism, say the few experts privy to its contents.	0
This is very bad news. The planet is more sensitive to increased carbon dioxide emissions than previously thought. The melting of permafrost has also defied expectations.	0
"According to the CEI complaint, NASA's decision to repeat the false claim violated the Information Quality Act (IQA). Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities. The claim appears on the NASA website on the page ""Climate Change: How Do We Know?"""	1
"Knowles had been discussing the absurdity of ""meatless"" diets and environmentalism. The climate hysteria movement is not about science. “If it were about science, it would be led by scientists rather than by politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.” This didn't go over well with the show's liberal guest."	2
The financial challenge for Europe is huge: the European Commission executive arm estimates that halving emissions by 2030 would require 260 billion euros (£222 billion) of investment a year in the energy, transport and construction sectors. We need climate cash in order to avoid a climate crash. Of the 1 trillion euros of the EU's 10-year investment plan, roughly half is to come from the EU long-term budget, the Commission said.	1
Much of the rest of the route is across private land, for which TC Energy has been acquiring permissions to build on. Oil will make climate change worse, and that the pipeline could break and spill oil into waterways like Montana's Missouri River. They have filed numerous lawsuits.	0
“But it’s important to recognize that what we’re seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures. It is the third time in 40 years in which warming halted ozone depletion. “It’s a rare event that we’re still trying to understand,” Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with the Universities Space Research Association, said in a statement.	1
Morrison on Monday boosted emergency funding for small businesses hit by the bushfires as the mounting costs of the disaster cast doubt on the government's ability to deliver a promised budget surplus. Strengthening Australia's carbon emission reduction targets will damage the economy. Public anger, however, remains high, stoked further when senior government officials publicly disputed climate change.	2
These perverse attitudes, Francis said, “certainly do not help honest research and sincere and fruitful dialogue on building the future of our planet: denial, indifference, resignation and trust in inadequate solutions.” Last June, the pope threw his moral weight behind a carbon tax, saying is imperative to oblige people to curb the use of fossil fuels. A carbon pricing policy is essential if humanity wants to use the resources of creation wisely. “The failure to manage carbon emissions has produced a huge debt that will now have to be repaid with interest from those who come after us.” The cost of carbon usage must be paid here and now by those who use it, and not deferred for future generations to cover, he proposed.	0
“We march in admission and recognition of the part we play in the injustice of this emergency, and the ongoing suffering of thousands of people around the world due to climate and ecological breakdown.” CLIMATE PROTEST IN EUROPE RESULT IN MORE THAN 250 ARRESTS, CRITICISM FROM GERMAN OFFICIAL According to the Guardian, five activists locked themselves together outside the door of the Kenyan High Commission to highlight the plight of the Sengwer people, who were displaced from their forest homes in the name of conservation. Any climate change solution should respect and take into consideration the rights of indigenous peoples around the world,. On Thursday, climate activists who climbed onto the roofs of trains were met with angry London commuters who took it upon themselves to drag them back to platforms.	1
Still, the agency notes that coal is far from dead: Hundreds of coal plants that have already been built in Asia are only 12 years old on average and are capable of operating for decades to come. It will be extremely difficult for the world to rapidly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. This carbon capture technology remains costly and has struggled to gain traction.	1
"The world needs an open dialogue about climate change to heal the gap between sceptics and believers since time is running out to cut the emissions that drive global warming. ""Time is pressing, so we - the older ones, I am 65 years old - must make sure that we take the impatience of young people positively and constructively,"" Merkel told the World Economic Forum in Switzerland."	0
That’s because it was billed as the ‘climate election’, which the left was supposed to win. Global warming is an election-winning issue. But the voters just aren’t interested.	1
"Bolsonaro has vowed to encourage economic development in the Amazon to lift the tribes from poverty and improve the lives of 30 million Brazilians who live there. His plans will speed up destruction of the rainforest, which is a bulwark against global climate change. ""We do not accept mining, agribusiness and the renting of our lands, nor logging, illegal fishing, hydroelectric dams or other projects that will impact us directly and irreversibly,"" the four-page document said."	0
He also focused on the “anti-human core” and the “authoritarian implications” of the Green New Deal proposed by the Democrats. Global warming will be small, slow, harmless and net beneficial. There is no case, rational, scientific, political, economic, social, moral or other for any mitigation of global warming.	2
A new study warns that even if countries curb their carbon emissions pledge as part of the historic 2015 Paris climate agreement, sea levels will continue to rise. Sea levels would rise approximately 20 centimeters by the year 2300 from emissions released between 2016 and 2030, when the Paris Agreement expires. “Even if we were to meet these initial goals of the Paris agreement, the sea level commitment from global warming will be significant,” said one of the study&aposs co-authors, Oregon State University climate scientist Peter Clark, in a statement.	1
But if you look at the facts, they tell a completely different story. Beef cattle produce only 3.3 percent of the total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. By comparison, the transportation and electrical industries generate 56 percent of our nation’s total GHG emissions.	2
"In January 2017, Judith Curry, former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech, resigned, calling out the alarmist ideology that increasingly dominates her field. I no longer know what to say to students and postdocs regarding how to navigate the CRAZINESS in the field of climate science. ""Research and other professional activities are professionally rewarded only if they are channeled in certain directions approved by a politicized academic establishment — funding, ease of getting your papers published, getting hired in prestigious positions, appointments to prestigious committees and boards, professional recognition, etc."""	1
If she were to return to the classroom, her lessons should serve to calm her fears. While the planet is in the midst of a warming trend of several hundred years, the Earth has not warmed at all since she was born. Her teachers could also assure her that our current temperatures are not at all unusual nor unprecedented, but very similar to previous warming trends over the last several thousand years.	2
Thunberg, who has taken a year off school to advocate action on climate change, hit back on Twitter, saying it did not take a degree to know the world was not meeting its climate targets. So either you tell us how to achieve this mitigation or explain to future generations and those already affected by the climate emergency why we should abandon our climate commitments. Before leaving Davos, Trump seemed to extend an olive branch, saying he wished he had seen Thunberg speak.	0
But those threats force the central bank, which prizes its political independence, to walk a tightrope. Democrats tend to be much more concerned with climate than Republicans. Against that backdrop, United States monetary policymakers have been slow to create a concerted climate change research program, even as peers like the Bank of England began to talk frequently about the economics of global warming.	1
"So, in Nature Communications there is a study claiming that ""climate deniers"" get too much media attention. 78 percent of the ""climate deniers"" whom the study paints as unscientific actually have articles published in peer-reviewed journals. That study also based its assumptions off of the Cook study, which blatantly misrepresented data."	2
He called the wave of fires starting in 2017 “a complete wake-up moment for an industry that thought it knew what was on its books, but actually didn’t.” When insurers try to respond to risks they don’t understand, they tend to set premiums too high, to give themselves a buffer against error, according to Dr. Kousky of the Wharton Risk Center. When it comes to climate change, insurers may respond by setting premiums so high that insurance in many parts of the country becomes unaffordable. By seeking to protect people from higher prices, regulators could make the problem worse by pushing insurers out of dangerous areas altogether, experts say.	1
• Climate emergency” or “climate crisis” will be used instead of “climate change.” • “Climate science denier” or “climate denier” to be used instead of “climate sceptic.” • “Use “global heating” not “global warming.” • “Greenhouse gas emissions” is preferred to “carbon emissions” or “carbon dioxide emissions.” Although carbon emissions is not inaccurate, if we’re talking about all gases that warm the atmosphere, this term recognizes all of the climate-damaging gases, including methane, nitrogen oxides, CFCs etc.” And the Guardian believes emotion-evoking animals in its reporting will serve a purpose. Today we pledge to give the climate crisis the attention it demands. “People need reminding that the climate crisis is no longer a future problem – we need to tackle it now, and every day matters.” “Since we announced these changes, they have been reported widely, shared across social media channels, and even prompted some other media outlets to reconsider the terms they use in their own coverage,” the Guardian reported, adding that it is now incorporating CO2 levels to its weather coverage.	0
24% … believe that half of climate scientists, or fewer, think human-caused global warming is happening. Between 51 and 90 percent of scientists think global warming is happening. 36% … correctly understand that almost all climate scientists think global warming is happening.	1
"U.S. climatologist and geophysicist Michael Mann told Reuters that Morrison's position was ""ridiculous"". If we continue to warm the planet, then we will in all likelihood exceed our adaptive capacity.

President Trump has begun the process of withdrawing the United States from the agreement, and the most recent climate talks to move the process forward, which were held in Madrid, were widely considered a disappointment. Governments are under a legal obligation, as well as a moral obligation, to significantly increase their ambition on climate change. Our human rights depend on it.” One of the plaintiffs in the case, Damian Rau, was 12 years old when the case was first filed.	0
Some signs indicate that glacial melt is “accelerating.” A common trick used by the National Park Service at GNP is to display old black-and-white photos of glaciers from bygone years (say, “1922”) next to photos of the same glaciers taken in more recent years showing the glaciers much diminished (say, “2006”). Glaciers tend to grow for nine months each winter and melt for three months each summer. Thus, such photo displays without precise calendar dates may be highly deceptive.	1
For areas at risk of weather disasters like severe flooding, it could also be crucial for transportation officials and emergency planners. The heightened capabilities will be increasingly important in the age of climate change. “The weather is getting more volatile, the impacts are getting more severe, and the financial impacts are rising as a result.” The IBM initiative comes at a time of rising apprehension about the commercialization of weather forecasting and climate modeling.	1
In “What If We…?” the music shifts halfway into the piece, from increasing gloom to a softer sound, representing what the world might be like if people implement changes in their behavior and government policies. Climate change is an urgent issue because we can still do something about it. After most performances, The ClimateMusic Project hosts question-and-answer sessions with the audience.	0
But if a nation in flames isn’t enough to produce a consensus for action — if it isn’t even enough to produce some moderation in the anti-environmentalist position — what will? Climate denial will persist come hell or high water. You might be tempted to dismiss Australia as a special case, but the same deepening partisan division has long been underway in the United States.	1
In 2018, the tiny Maldives Islands were scheduled to sink beneath the waves due to climate change — yet the islands have actually grown in recent years! Climate is an extremely complicated science that remains far less than fully understood. While it stands to reason that carbon emissions may have an impact on the global climate, there is little concrete evidence to prove it — and nearly every prediction made on this hypothesis has proven false.	2
Kiryn from the Bay Area commented: “I fear this is going to be normal for my daughter, who is too young to remember when the rains still started to fall in October and we didn’t call Autumn ‘Fire Season.’ But we can’t really leave — we’ve lived here all our lives, we’ve got good jobs, and all our family and friends are here. There are fewer climate problems elsewhere. Just different ones.” Jeff Dozier, professor emeritus and founding dean of the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara, wrote in that while building codes exist, community codes more or less do not in fire-prone areas — and need to.	2
“Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific,” the scientists stated in their declaration sent to the U.N. secretary general. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation. The signers also insisted that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable trend of the day.	2
The cost alone is mind-boggling. The low-carbon electricity grid alone will cost $5.4 trillion. The “New Zero Emissions Transportation System” will cost about $2 trillion.	1
He has promoted statistics that show American emissions have fallen 13 percent since 2005, but he also is a critic of the Paris Agreement, a pledge among nearly every nation to curb emissions that Mr. Trump intends to abandon next November. Reductions of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are being nullified by rising emissions in China. In replacing Mr. Perry, Mr. Brouillette becomes the latest lobbyist and seasoned second-in-command to take over for an embattled, higher-profile cabinet secretary.	1
“In both cases, huge amounts of money, time, and legal expertise were thrown at these claims in an attempt to make a legal case that climate change has been harmful.” “The bottom line is that while yes, we’ve seen some changes in our climate over the past century, with improved crop yields, better health, reduced deaths from weather disasters, and increasingly less impoverishment worldwide, it is hard to argue that an increase of about 1 degree Centigrade has been detrimental to humanity,” the statement continued. Ill-informed kids keep being manipulated by radical environmentalists to sue over purported future climate damages. “It’s time for federal and state courts to say enough is enough and toss all such lawsuits, recognizing as the Ninth Circuit did that it’s the job of elected branches, not the judiciary, to determine climate and energy policy.” “Undoubtedly, the plaintiffs arrived in court using transportation that relies on the very fossil fuels they would stop the world from using, and pleaded in a court house whose lights and indoor climate controls depend on those very same fossil fuels,” Burnett said.	2
One environmental activist expressed reservations that Mr. Fioramonti’s plan may be too dogmatic. Climate change is not primarily caused by man. “To listen to people who say different things is good,” he said.	2
In some ways, the costs of reducing climate change are overstated. Risky technologies are the only ways to address climate change. If you think about more public transit, more sustainable diets, more high-tech communities with perhaps more modest homes, these are things that can benefit people in the future, and likewise, I think in developing countries it will also require a shift away from present trends.	0
"""In the real world, climate change is far too challenging a threat to be ended by one person — or even one battle that doesn’t include all of the major powers,"" Romm piously preached.

The Zen scholar Thich Nhat Hanh has said that technology makes major contributions to the minor needs of man. Climate change means the end of shopping. I think there is a lot of wisdom in both those suggestions.	1
The Hollywood Foreign Press Association said Thursday that it wants the initiative to raise environmental awareness about food consumption and waste. The Golden Globes to send a signal and draw attention to the issue about climate change. “The food we eat, the way we grow the food we eat, the way we dispose of the food is one of the large contributors to the climate crisis.” The annual awards ceremony will air on NBC from The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.	1
Climate summits are stuck in a rut. The job of cutting global emissions is actually getting harder, and not just because the planet keeps warming.	1
“As the climate crisis worsens each day and California burns and Iowa floods, Trump continues to abandon science and our international leadership,” Mr. Biden tweeted. I actually see an opportunity in this, as bad as it has gotten with both how close we are to catastrophe in climate and the disappearance of U.S. leadership from the world stage. “I also see in that the opportunity to do something important, which is, restore American credibility.” Several lower-polling candidates hoping for breakthroughs also weighed in.	0
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) joined climate change strikers outside of the Iowa Capitol Building in Des Moines as part of Friday’s global climate strike. Climate change is not a hoax, but climate change is a terrible, terrible reality impacting our country and the entire world today. “Not tomorrow, but today.” He told the group of activists: “And we know that if we’re going to save this planet … we have got to take on the fossil fuel industry, and we have got to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel,” he said, calling for “sustainable energy.” He said the “very bad” and “scary” news is that we face a “global existential crisis.” The good news, Sanders said, is “we can address this crisis if we have the courage to stand up to greedy and powerful special interests.” “I’m proud to stand with young people in Iowa and around the world today in their climate strikes,” Sanders wrote alongside a video of his appearance at the event.	0

Scientists say that if we all went vegan, it could save the lives of up to 8 million humans (not to mention billions of animals), cut greenhouse gas emissions by two-thirds and prevent 1.5 trillion dollars’ worth of climate-related damage by 2050. More than half of food-related greenhouse gas emissions come from meat, eggs and dairy. “It’s estimated that each vegan spares nearly 200 animals every year and that’s just counting the animals who are killed and eaten, like chickens, cows, pigs and fish.” The U.N. also blames animal agriculture, which helps feed people around the world, for habitat loss and the recent fires in the Amazon rainforest.	1
Piers Corbyn, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexiteer climate-sceptic elder brother, has lambasted Extinction Rebellion as a Soros-funded, EU- and UN-backed scam to transfer money from ordinary people to corporations. Climate policy is there to control you, not climate. “The political origin of [Extinction Rebllion] is the globalist supernationals, the mega-rich.	2
“Special needs is the new normal in this country,” he said, adding, “We have to stop confusing economic value and human value.” Of course, it helped that no one onstage seemed to see any advantage in challenging him. The government should pay to help Americans move out of places impacted by climate change. The moderator’s closing question was quirky: Would you prefer to ask for forgiveness or give someone a gift?	0

It followed months of negotiations between regional officials and Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. Germany, one of the strongest and most successful industry nations in the world, is taking huge steps toward leaving the fossil fuel era. Germany’s timetable, though, could present challenges to the European Union’s efforts to swiftly cut its greenhouse gas emissions, as the bloc’s new leadership has announced.	1
It is one of the fastest-retreating glaciers in Antarctica, and calving incidents have increased in recent years, NASA reported. Warming ocean currents are also melting the glacier from underneath, washing ice away faster than the glacier can replenish it. Prior to the 2018 calving, the glacier suffered two more massive ice losses in 2015 and 2017, raising concerns among glaciologists for the region&aposs future stability.	0
The world needs to prepare for millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change. Speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum, Filippo Grandi said a U.N. ruling this week meant those fleeing as a result of climate change deserved international protection, and that it had broad implications for governments.	0
Steven Pinker seems to think so. If mankind wanted to stop climate change without stopping economic growth too, the world needed more nuclear energy, not less. Germany’s decision to step out of nuclear, he agreed, was “paranoid.” My country has embarked on a unique experiment indeed.	1
"If anything, U.S. temperatures are now slightly cooler than they were 14 years ago [see graph below, where temperature is in degrees Fahrenheit on the left]."" Climate crisis advocates attempt to dismiss the minor satellite-measured warming by utilizing ground temperature stations around the globe, which tend to have even more corrupting biases and problems than the old U.S. stations. There is very little data for the 70 percent of Earth’s surface that is ocean."	2
“But we don’t account for that when the damage happens.” International programs like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, or REDD+, are seen as a way to help limit global warming by using financial incentives to halt ongoing deforestation, thus conserving forests’ carbon-storing capabilities. Protecting still-undamaged forests could have a strong climate benefit as well. “From a number of different angles there’s a rising realization that we need to do more than just the core REDD approach,” Dr. Evans said.	0
Yang, to his credit, said Democrats must “stop being obsessed over impeachment.” His policy ideas may be a bit wonky, but of all the Democrats on stage, he seems to be the most genuine. The word climate change, to the best of my knowledge, is not discussed in this new NAFTA agreement at all, which is an outrage. But crazy Bernie wasn’t done being crazy.	0

Climate Action Summit in New York accusing world leaders of robbing her of her future, these signatories were begging the United Nations to keep hysteria from obscuring facts. Climate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific. “Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation.” The signatories underscored the importance of not rushing into enormously expensive climate action before fully ascertaining the facts.	1
While global investment in renewable energy hit $289 billion in 2018, far exceeding the investment in new fossil fuel power, wind and solar remain a small portion of total energy production. The real evidence of change would come when investors started exiting carbon-heavy companies, especially those with no transition plan. “What is going to cause the change?” she added.	1

In the United States, climate change was seen as the second biggest challenge after access to healthcare, and more important than the third biggest threat -- political instability. Two thirds of people in Europe, the United States and China think their individual behaviour can help tackle climate change and more than three quarters of parents believe their children will bear the consequences of climate change. The survey also showed 93% of the Chinese were choosing public transport over cars for environmental purposes.	1
And with that question, he opened the door to an incredibly constructive conversation about science, faith and truth. Climate change is not a belief system. We know that the earth’s climate is changing thanks to observations, facts and data about God’s creation that we can see with our eyes and test with the sound minds that God has given us.	1
Science is not the point. We are headed for climate Armageddon from warming in twelve years. These days, to run for president as a Democrat, you have to pledge the most absolute allegiance to the church of climate.	0
He also said he was disappointed that Mr. Sanders no longer supported a carbon tax, a position he embraced in 2016. A fee on the burning of fossil fuels is the most efficient way to drive down global warming. Still, Mr. Oppenheimer said, Mr. Sanders wins points on vision.	0
"CEI Senior Fellow Pat Michaels described the Paris Agreement as ""climatically meaningless"" and warned that the deal ""guarantees that China will produce the lion's share of carbon dioxide emissions for the foreseeable future."" Since 2005, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have dropped more than those from any other large industrialized nation. We didn’t have Paris in 2005 and we don’t need it now."""	1
To change that, we offered two broad recommendations. Countries need to go beyond simply putting a price on carbon or adopting bold emissions goals. What’s required is a more strategic approach to policymaking aimed at reconfiguring technologies, business models, infrastructure and markets in each country’s greenhouse-gas-emitting economic sectors to reduce emissions.	1

The first two days of the annual Davos gathering were dominated by the back-and-forth between the 73-year-old former businessman Trump and 17-year-old campaigner Greta Thunberg, with corporate leaders caught in the middle, concerned that as well as words, there was a need for concrete decisions. Opposing sides in polarised debates such as that on climate change had to learn how to talk with each other again. (Reporting by Joseph Nasr, editing by Thomas Escritt)	1
The former archbishop has voiced his support for the Greta Thunberg-led climate school strikes and last year backed Extinction Rebellion in its calls for mass protest in reaction to the “unprecedented global emergency” of anthropomorphic climate change. Anthropomorphic climate change is a scam. “We’ve got arguably the largest challenge ever to the human race in the shape of an environmental crisis,” he said during an interview with artist Grayson Perry.	2
But we know it is catastrophic.” The report, and its focus on children, comes at a time when youth climate demonstrations including school strike protests spearheaded by Greta Thunberg, the Sunrise movement and Extinction Rebellion have attracted attention. This may be the first time in the history of the United States that there are children wondering whether they are going to have a future, whether they should have children as a result of the potential for climate change to get worse and worse. This year, Jamie Margolin, the 17-year-old founder of the climate activist group Zero Hour testified before Congress.	0

“We have a well-funded effort to fundamentally change how climate science is characterized in the academic literature,” states author Roger Pielke, “how that science is reported in the media, and ultimately how political discussions and policy options are shaped.” Climate change activists are so anxious to get their point across that they are willing to cut academic corners, fudge data, and misuse models to create scenarios that respond to their needs, even if not to the truth. The corruption of climate science has occurred because some of our most important institutions have let us down. “The scientific peer review process has failed to catch obvious methodological errors in research papers.	2
“Australians have never been fussed about trying to impress people overseas or respond to what others tell us we should think or what we should do,” Mr. Morrison said. His antipathy toward action on climate change has contributed to what they consider a hands-off response to the fires, treating them as a tragedy rather than a turning point. For months, Mr. Morrison rebuffed calls for a more forceful intervention by the federal government — like a broad military deployment or the largely symbolic declaration of a national emergency — by noting that firefighting had long been the responsibility of individual states.	1
LONDON — British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is meeting the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on Thursday to discuss climate finance, Johnson's spokesman said. The financial sector has been too slow to address the risks from climate change and that politicians need to effect change now. Johnson will also attend a summit on Libya in Germany on Sunday, the spokesman said.	0
Those regular wind events can lead to crisis when they intersect with the drier landscape and man-made triggers like the state’s failing private power infrastructure. California is about 3 degrees Fahrenheit warmer today than it would be without climate change. “And so everything is occurring against that warmer backdrop.” The devastating Tubbs fire in 2017 was on the minds of emergency response teams as the Kincade fire began to spread the night of Oct. 23, said Mark Essick, who was sworn in as Sonoma County’s sheriff in January.	1
An artist by training and a producer by profession, Ms. Kodikara, who was born in England to Sri Lankan parents, had been involved with organizations championing immigration reform and helping asylum seekers, but, she said, “I hadn’t really thought about the connections between migration, immigration and climate because the common narratives hadn’t made climate appear relevant to black and brown people at all.” That changed after a conversation with her friend, Thanu Yakupitiyage, associate director of United States communications for 350.org, who had previously worked in immigration reform. I realized with all that has separated us from each other, climate justice is the great unifier. She and the co-hosts “understand the value of supporting these women and listening to the knowledge that they’ve hoarded for generations,” Ms. Kodikara said.	1

For example, in Science class she would learn that worldwide surface measurements reveal that, while the planet is in the midst of a warming trend of several hundred years, the Earth has not warmed at all since she was born. Our current temperatures are not at all unusual nor unprecedented, but very similar to previous warming trends over the last several thousand years. Moving on to Biology class, she could explore how plants rely on carbon dioxide (CO2) as the basic building block in the process of photosynthesis.	2

In any case, it isn’t necessary. There is a realistic win-win outcome: with the right government policies, we can stimulate investment in green energy, efficient cities, better transportation and the like, which will address climate change as well as make many of our lives better and more comfortable. Just think about it: Many Americans spend hours every day in traffic.	0
“The best science, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, tells us that any temperature rise above 1.5 degrees will lead to major and irreversible damage to the ecosystems that support us. Science tells us that on our current path, we face at least 3-degrees Celsius of global heating by the end of the century. “The climate emergency is a race we are losing, but it is a race we can win,” he declared.	1
Morrison won by representing himself as an everyman. Australians care about the high cost of environmental activism based on questionable climate alarmism. Just as the high cost of the Green New Deal drives people away from that radical legislation, so Australia's Labor Party lost by championing climate alarm at costs that voters are not willing to stomach.	2
In fact, the text states, we see that “nations are failing to keep pace with their commitments, that the dangers and damage of climate change are even worse than we feared, and that the time remaining for us to halt climate damage is less than we hoped.” In the U.N. climate talks, “we learned that 200 nations have failed to respond sufficiently to the growing urgency of the climate crisis,” it notes. The gap is widening between the steps taken by governments in response to the climate emergency, on the one hand, and the compelling scientific evidence and moral obligation to act, on the other.

“We already spend $129 billion per year subsidizing solar and wind energy, yet these sources meet just 1.1% of our global energy needs,” he adds, and yet the IEA estimates that “by 2040 — after we have spent a whopping $3.5 trillion on additional subsidies — solar and wind will still meet less than 5% of our needs.” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol put the figures in stark perspective, noting that in 2018, electric cars saved 40 million tons of CO2 worldwide, equivalent to reducing global temperatures by a mere 0.000018°C — or a little more than a hundred-thousandth of a degree Celsius — by the end of the century. You can save the climate with electric cars. The fact is, Lombord declares “cheap and reliable energy underpins human prosperity” and this will be provided by fossil fuels until alternative sources of cheap and reliable energy can be found.	0

A decade ago, many people viewed climate action and economic growth as being in conflict. Long-term growth and climate action are inextricably linked. For example, a report by the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate found that bold action on protecting the climate could generate over $26 trillion in benefits through 2030.	1
Mr. Pompeo, in his remarks on Twitter, said that the United States would still maintain a voice in international discussions on global warming. We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters. “Just as we have in the past, the United States will continue to research, innovate, and grow our economy while reducing emissions and extending a helping hand to our friends and partners around the globe,” he said.	0

“In our view, the clearest emergency would be if we were approaching a global cascade of tipping points that led to a new, less habitable, ‘hothouse’ climate state,” the authors warn, while arguing that that cascading effects “might” be common.

According to the recent National Climate Assessment, by the end of the century, warming at the current trajectory would cost the American economy hundreds of billions of dollars from crop damage, lost labor and the consequences of extreme weather. Climate change could cost the United States 10.5 percent in real income by 2100. In addition, by backing away from the international climate pact, the United States will fail to fully seize the economic opportunities in the growing clean energy sector.	0

Immediate clearing of intact forests, what might be considered “classic” deforestation, over that period accounted for about 3 percent of global emissions from deforestation in all tropical forests, the researchers said.

“Things are getting worse,” said Petteri Taalas, Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organization, which on Tuesday issued its annual state of the global climate report, concluding a decade of what it called exceptional global heat.

Beginning in the 1970s, federal officials used the act to prosecute and fine companies up to $15,000 per bird for accidental deaths on power lines, in oil pits, in wind turbines and by other industrial hazards. Fossil fuel companies had been unfairly targeted by the law. “It felt like it was weaponized against one industry,” she said.	1
“For example,” he writes, “experimental research discovered that when free-market enthusiasts who are concerned about government regulation hear from experts who emphasize how companies are developing climate responses, they are more likely to accept climate science.” Who makes for the best messenger depends, naturally, on the intended recipient. Because climate change perceptions in children seem less susceptible to the influence of worldview or political context, it may be possible for them to inspire adults toward higher levels of climate concern, and in turn, collective action. Child-to-parent intergenerational learning — that is, the transfer of knowledge, attitudes or behaviors from children to parents — may be a promising pathway to overcoming socio-ideological barriers to climate concern.	0
For decades, climate change was a prediction about the future, so scientists talked about it in the future tense. Climate disruption is underway. Scientists also often focus on regions of extreme vulnerability, such as Bangladesh or the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, which for most Americans are very remote, both physically and psychically.	0
But a new study suggests these programs would do well to also preserve forests where deforestation and degradation haven’t begun. Gradual loss of these largely pristine, intact forests has a much greater climate impact than previously accounted for. Globally, forests take more than a quarter of the carbon emissions from human activities out of the atmosphere every year.	0

"The U.S. has 10 years left to act on climate change. ""At this point there can be no shadow of a doubt that our own excesses and emissions and inaction politically and as a country and a democracy, where each of us comprise the government, have led to the warming we've seen so far -- one degree Celsius just since 1980,"" O'Rourke said during the ""We the People Membership Forum"" in Washington on Monday."	0
"They aren't even in the league of the average career climate scientist."" 224 of the 386 ""climate change contrarians"" quoted by the media have at least one publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The study did not mention how many of the ""climate change scientists"" quoted by the media had published articles, but the authors selected 224 of their papers and showed how their papers were more heavily cited."	1
“An effective PHW is vital to galvanise much needed action to address the growing threats to planetary health including urgent actions to address the climate crisis,” the authors conclude. Publishing papers on climate change in academic literature based on flawed methods is a formula. “We have a well-funded effort to fundamentally change how climate science is characterized in the academic literature,” states author Roger Pielke, “how that science is reported in the media, and ultimately how political discussions and policy options are shaped.” Climate change activists are so anxious to get their point across that they are willing to cut academic corners, fudge data, and misuse models to create scenarios that respond to their needs, even if not to the truth.	2
At home, Australian voters have also become increasingly concerned about the growing influence of Chinese money in the country’s political scene. Our economy is vitally dependent on fossil fuels, and yet our landscape is relatively exposed to climate change. Shifting the world’s 14th-largest economy would be no easy task, no matter how much the government might do.	1
The study placed the papers into seven categories: explicit endorsement with quantification, saying humans are responsible for 50+ percent of climate change; explicit endorsement without quantification; implicit endorsement; no position or uncertain; implicit rejection; explicit rejection with qualification; and explicit rejection without qualification. Natural causes explain climate change. So how did Cook and his team come up with the 97 percent number?	2
"But in addition to being a Warrior for Gaia, Booker wants to set up an ""Environmental Justice Fund"" to fix the problem of income inequality. What does economic inequality have to do with climate change? Well, nothing."	1
Although I began my career as a wildlife ecologist, my work in the tourism industry is focused on transforming travel to be more environmentally friendly. Flying is harmful to the climate. Conservation and poverty alleviation will suffer twin blows.	0
But, no candidate seems more obsessed with climate change than Bernie Sanders. Global climate change initiatives are just rebranded socialist policies. When given the opportunity to talk about the lack of diversity on the debate stage, Sanders chose to ignore the question and just start gabbing about climate change.	2
“I think people don’t care as much about taxes as they care about how their life is going,” said Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist who helped develop a list of possible tax increases and spending cuts that Ms. Warren drew on to fund her health care proposal. Our climate problems have only gotten worse. “Corporate greed has only gotten worse.	0
At the end of last year, Lawrence Bacow, the president of Harvard, told The Harvard Crimson that there were more effective ways to “bring about meaningful change” than divestment. While we agree on the urgency of this global challenge, we respectfully disagree with divestment activists on the means by which a university should confront it. “Universities like Harvard have a crucial role to play in tackling climate change and Harvard is fully committed to leadership in this area through research, education, community engagement, dramatically reducing its own carbon footprint, and using our campus as a test bed for piloting and proving solutions.” Karen N. Peart, a Yale spokeswoman, said, referring to the protest, that the university stood “firmly for the right to free expression” but added that it was “regrettable that the orchestrated protest came during a time when fellow students were participating in a collegiate career-defining contest and an annual tradition when thousands gather from around the world to enjoy and celebrate the storied traditions of both football programs and universities.” This is not the first public action taken against Ivy League endowments.	0
It very difficult to write plays about climate change. By the time one of her climate change plays reached the stage, the science had changed to the point that the play was outdated.	1
However, the scariest reporting I’ve seen recently has been about science, not politics. Climate change in the Arctic is accelerating, matching what used to be considered worst-case scenarios. And there are indications that Arctic warming may be turning into a self-reinforcing spiral, as the thawing tundra itself releases vast quantities of greenhouse gases.	0
BATON ROUGE, La. The U.S. government violated their human rights by failing to take action on climate change. The complaint was filed Wednesday, The Advocate reported.	0
Shortages have plagued places from California to Cape Town, South Africa, which narrowly escaped running out of water last year. But Australia, the most arid inhabited continent, is unique among developed nations in its vulnerability to the effects of climate change. With the country’s driest spring on record just concluded and another hot, parched summer likely to be ahead, the challenge of keeping Australia hydrated is only becoming more urgent.	0
The number of people threatened by climate change-triggered flooding is about three times higher than previously thought. But it&aposs not because of more water.	0
“I guess I’m as shocked as anyone about what’s unfolding and, probably, like everyone else who’s involved and affected, we’ll very quickly recalibrate thinking about what we’re doing,” he said. Few signs of ending and temperatures are expected to continue to climb after the warmest decade on record. “We would be extremely foolish, given all the evidence and the magnitude of this event, to just laugh it off as a one-off phenomenon,” Dr. Bradstock said.	0
That figure, combined with other regulatory changes the group claimed credit for, “demonstrates just how much value NAHB delivers for members,” the association wrote. The effects of decisions like these will be felt for generations as global warming leads to more powerful storms and higher risk of damage to property. “Our definition of cost is what it costs the families when the home is built poorly,” said Leslie Chapman-Henderson, president of the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes, a consumer advocacy group.	0
"""No-one has been able to fill the previous political leadership role on climate change that was played by the U.S. in the past,"" said Majid Jafar, chief executive of UAE-based Crescent Petroleum. If the world replaced all coal with gas, it would achieve the Paris climate target of by keeping global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The problem is that the biggest coal consumers, China and India, would need incentives to switch from cheaper coal, he said."	1
Though American participation in the Paris Agreement will ultimately be determined by the outcome of the 2020 election, supporters of the pact say they have to plan for a future without American cooperation. Mr. Trump, who has mocked climate science as a hoax, will begin actively working against global efforts to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas. Keeping up the pressure for the kinds of economic change necessary to stave off the worse effects of planetary warming will be much harder without the world’s superpower.	1
“But we can’t build a global network on our own; we will need partner institutions and supporters from all around the world to join us in this enterprise.” “I consider OSUN the most important and enduring project of my life and I should like to see it implemented while I am still around,” Soros said. Climate protection may become a matter of survival for Europe and the entire planet. “The question of being able to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement could become a question of survival,” Merkel said in a speech Thursday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.	0
Fonda helped kick off the rally by claiming that a transition to green energy will create million of jobs. The climate emergency requires us to rapidly transform our energy system and key industrial sectors in ways that protect workers and impacted communities. “Transforming our industrial base and energy systems can and will creation millions of good jobs.	0
That sounds like good news for the environment, but is it really? Agriculture, in general, is responsible for a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. In the United States, farming accounts for roughly 9 percent of emissions.	1

Researchers say that if too much permafrost thaws it will create a self-reinforcing cycle wherein thawing permafrost will lead to still more thawing permafrost, which in turn will make climate change worse. More carbon is being released than stored. “The key question really remains as to whether the measurements in Alaska over a several year period are representative of the broader Arctic system of other regions in the Arctic where permafrost exists,” said Matthew Druckenmiller, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder and one of the report’s editors.	1
As terrifying as the threat of wildfires is, what happens after the fire is just as worrisome to climate adaptation experts. Even insurers are struggling to predict the risks associated with climate change. The consequences of that failure could be profound, experts say: The very industry that’s meant to stabilize society in the face of climate change is itself being destabilized by climate change, threatening to make it harder for people to cope with the rising tempo of disasters.	1
“We have hotels in Puerto Rico that are still closed,” he said. Climate change could cause the next financial crisis. Mark Carney, the departing Bank of England governor who has spearheaded efforts to get central banks to carry out stress tests assessing climate impacts on sectors, said companies needed to examine and disclose their strategies and timelines for lowering their carbon footprints.	0
Walmart has committed to this goal. Businesses that embrace a high-efficiency, low-carbon model will have a better chance to survive and grow in the 21st century. Innovation is essential for any business, but especially in the face of the growing risks and uncertainty of climate change.	1
President Trump earlier in the week obliquely referred to them as “the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers.” Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany urged world leaders on Thursday to “take the impatience of young people positively and constructively.” Andrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute, said the youth movement had acted as “a very valuable nudge” to business and political leaders to transition away from a global economy driven by fossil fuels. No one can come to Davos anymore and not understand climate science. “You look stupid, frankly,” he said.	1
Climate is always changing and humans are always adapting, writes Iceland’s former prime minister, so people should stop panicking over global warming. Some glaciers melt while others grow and it has been this way for all of history. “Our climate changes, but humans adapt.	1
He claimed to know that neither God nor nature played a role in the Guatemala drought. Manmade climate change may have played some role. No, he insisted that it was the exclusive cause.	1
In the Arctic, ground can be permanently frozen from near the surface to several thousand feet deep. We see warming across the board, and generally the rate of warming is increasing. “But the impact varies significantly.” Her recent research found rapid thawing of permafrost high in the Canadian Arctic, where there is little surface vegetation to insulate the frozen ground.	0
Most of the fires have been caused by lightning strikes, though some people have misleadingly pointed to arson in an effort to minimize the links to climate change and the Australian government’s inaction on the issue. The drought is unrelated to climate change. “The wildfires decimating Australia, killing people, ravaging wild habitats and pushing communities and firefighters to their absolute limits are growing and coalescing into the country’s worst peacetime catastrophe precisely because of climate change,” said Paul Read, a co-director of the National Center for Research in Bushfire and Arson at Monash University in Melbourne.	2
"""No part of the U.S. is favored to have below-average temperatures this winter,"" according to the outlook. Global climate patterns that typically influence winter weather patterns are weak this year, leading to complicated forecasts. ""I would say that this is not one of our most confident forecasts,"" Mike Halpert, deputy director of NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said on a conference call with reporters."	1
But Europe has been threatening such a tax for years and, so far, has not followed through. The United States would still maintain a voice in international discussions on global warming. “We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters,” he said.	1
In the wake of that catastrophe, “the system as we knew it became untenable,” he wrote in 2006. The immense, still-unfolding tragedy of the Australian fires may yet prove to be the Chernobyl of climate crisis.	0
Her name is Naomi Seibt, she’s 19 years old, but unlike some teenage activists we could mention she is most definitely not welcome at the UN’s COP25 climate conference. The global warming scare is a massive hoax. Worse — and being a German, she should know — Naomi believes that her Chancellor’s green policies are steering her country inexorably towards the kind of totalitarianism it last experienced in the 1930s and the 1940s.	2

"They are simply being used as ""human shields"" for adult climate activists who recognize that the climate scare will soon lose credibility as global warming Armageddon fails to materialize as forecast. The world may have already begun to cool in response to a weakening Sun, a phenomenon far more dangerous than any possible human-induced warming. In our August 20 America Out Loud article, The Disgraceful Use of Children to Promote the Climate Change Delusion, we explained: At the center of Baal was the human sacrifice of children to supposedly achieve some change in the weather."	2
“Together we’ll address the climate crisis that’s already having increasingly large and damaging effects on every one of our communities,” said Kathleen A. Theoharides, the Massachusetts secretary of energy and environmental affairs. The things we do to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from transportation also deliver enormous benefits to public health and the economy. The cap-and-trade market for transportation reflects how policymakers have increasingly shifted their focus from the power sector — where natural gas and renewables have quickly replaced coal, helping energy companies to reduce their carbon footprints — toward transportation, where gasoline engines still dominate.	0
“It’s a rare event that we’re still trying to understand,” Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with the Universities Space Research Association, said in a statement. These scientific events are not linked to climate change. The weather systems that disrupted the 2019 ozone hole, known as “sudden stratospheric warming” events, were 29 degrees higher than average.	2
“The hazardous air pollution from the New South Wales bushfires is one of the ways people’s health is being harmed by climate change right now,” said Fiona Armstrong, executive director of the Climate and Health Alliance, an advocacy group in Australia. Southern Australia is likely to see an increased risk of fire as the world heats up as a result of the burning of fossil fuels. On Friday, smoke from fires in eastern Victoria had reached more than 100 miles west to Melbourne.	0
Also, warmer temperatures bring longer growing seasons and fewer devastating frost events. Climate activists are telling tall tales when they assert that climate change is causing global or regional crop devastation. The proof is in the objective crop production data.	2
"Even ""if the United States reduced its emissions to zero, it would have no impact on global warming, because Chinese emissions have gone up so rapidly."" American diplomacy can convince the communist country to buck its own self-interest in favor of global climate alarmism. Interestingly, Biden was the point person for the Obama administration's efforts on China, and he reportedly went soft on the Middle Kingdom while his son carried out massive deals with Chinese officials."	2

[nL8N28L35D] The last time there was a comparable concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was between 3 and 5 million years ago, when the temperature was between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius warmer and sea levels were 10 to 20 metres higher than today, scientists say. Although the data series started in 1958 has always shown CO2 concentrations increasing year-on-year, driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation, the rate of rise has not been perfectly even. Fluctations in the amount of CO2 absorbed by tropical forests and other natural carbon sinks can affect overall levels of the gas in the atmosphere.	1
So is Greta [Thunberg, the teenage climate activist from Sweden], so is every young person,” she told TMZ. Many young adults have become anxious about whether to have children, given issues related to climate change. “Just because we want to make sure we’re bringing our kids into a healthy world, and a stable future,” she said.	1
That is a good thing,” said James Taylor, Director of the Arthur B. Robinson Center for Climate and Environmental Policy at The Heartland Institute. Regardless of the reasons for climate change, we all know from the facts that the climate is changing. “We have longer, hotter, and drier fire seasons.	0
