- a lot of clauses about how the coal/nat. gas industries are crumbling
- stuff whose stance is not clear, though relevant to climate change, e.g. "A large number of these plants are expected to close"--4th category? Could lead to an interesting topic distribution analysis of media
- categories: 0 (pro), 1 (anti), 2 (neither, but relevant to topic), 3 (irrelevant to debate topic)

Other notes:
- instead of classification, some kind of topic analysis?
- other potential categories: promoting own side, bashing enemy side
- annotator's own stance might affect their annotations
- what's the most valuable contrib? no large stance annotation datasets for climate change (or vaccines) (on non-tweet data)

Potential targets:
- taking action on climate change is important
- climate change is a real concern
- *people should be worried about climate change*
