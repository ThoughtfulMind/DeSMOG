that stratospheric water contributed to enhancing the warming observed during 1980–2000		Although earlier data are less complete, the observations also suggest that stratospheric water contributed to enhancing the warming observed during 1980–2000.		1

that short - term variability even on the scale of a decade ( in either the hot or not hot direction ) is a distraction if one is looking for evidence of human - driven warming or trying to build an argument for or against curbing emissions of greenhouse gases		One lesson, discussed by me for many years, is that short-term variability even on the scale of a decade (in either the hot or not hot direction) is a distraction if one is looking for evidence of human-driven warming or trying to build an argument for or against curbing emissions of greenhouse gases.		1

Craven makes a point of not telling you what to think		Craven makes a point of not telling you what to think; instead, the book is about giving you the tools to think for yourself — to evaluate what you hear, to assess the credibility of various sources, to avoid falling prey to common errors of thought.		3

As Craven points out , what will save us is n’t the spread of personal shifts in consumption		As Craven points out, what will save us isn’t the spread of personal shifts in consumption; it’s the spread, among well-meaning people, of a new way to think about the risks of climate change.		2

Could you be wrong		Quietly ask the its-a-hoaxers, “Could you be wrong?” Spread Greg’s YouTube video or the book, and ask them to pass it on.		3

you make the decision mindfully , by “ choosing your future regrets		Craven suggests you make the decision mindfully, by “choosing your future regrets,” and that you use this same approach in deciding how much time and energy to give.		3

his videos go viral		Having seen his videos go viral, he’s well aware of how powerful spreading the word can be.		3

our children ’s earth go down the tubes		We can view it as “my actions are doomed, doomed,” become disempowered and paralyzed and watch our children’s earth go down the tubes; or instead we can see it as Craven does: “Picture each small action you take as a lottery ticket.		3

that the size should suit your lifestyle and that “ you ’re not spreading the message of “ OhMyGodWe’veGotToDoSomethingAboutGlobalWarming! … instead , you ’re spreading the meme of asking people to think ”		Craven offers a range of ideas for action, from bite-sized to jumbo, reminding you that the size should suit your lifestyle and that “you’re not spreading the message of “OhMyGodWe’veGotToDoSomethingAboutGlobalWarming!…instead, you’re spreading the meme of asking people to think”; plus you’re asking them to pass it on, which is the multiplier that makes the real impact.		1

how ice - age cycles help show the amplifying power of greenhouse gases		Dr. Alley, a glaciologist and climate scientist at Penn State, is a longtime contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, author of a nice history of ice and climate, “The Two-Mile Time Machine,” and — as many Dot Earth readers are aware — a teacher with musical and terpsichorean talents (see the YouTube video below for his orbital dance explaining how ice-age cycles help show the amplifying power of greenhouse gases).		0

that some of the temperature changes ( the ice - age cycling ) are very widespread and shared among most records , but other of the temperature changes ( sometimes called millennial , or abrupt , or Younger - Dryas - type ) are antiphased between Greenland and the south , and still other temperature changes may be unrelated between different places ( one anomalously cold year in Greenland does not tell you the temperature anomaly in Australia or Peru )		One of the lessons drawn from comparing Greenland to Antarctica and many other places is that some of the temperature changes (the ice-age cycling) are very widespread and shared among most records, but other of the temperature changes (sometimes called millennial, or abrupt, or Younger-Dryas-type) are antiphased between Greenland and the south, and still other temperature changes may be unrelated between different places (one anomalously cold year in Greenland does not tell you the temperature anomaly in Australia or Peru).		1

Second , although the central Greenland ice - core records may provide the best paleoclimatic temperature records available , multiple parameters confirm the strong temperature signal , and multiple cores confirm the widespread nature of the signal		Second, although the central Greenland ice-core records may provide the best paleoclimatic temperature records available, multiple parameters confirm the strong temperature signal, and multiple cores confirm the widespread nature of the signal, the data still contain a lot of noise over short times (snowdrifts are real, among other things).		2

An isotopic record from one site is not purely a temperature record at that site		An isotopic record from one site is not purely a temperature record at that site, so care is required to interpret the signal and not the noise.		2

that humans are not now responsible		Thirdly, demonstration that there have been large climate changes in the past without humans in no way demonstrates that humans are not now responsible.		1

Many people have died naturally but murder still exists		Many people have died naturally but murder still exists; it is up to the police to learn whether a given mortality was natural or not, and up to climate science to learn what is causing ongoing changes (and we have good confidence that most of what is happening to climatic global average surface temperature is being caused by humanity now).		3

that warmer temperatures in the future are good for us		Similarly, demonstration that life, and humans, survived warmer temperatures in the past in no way shows that warmer temperatures in the future are good for us.		1

a big change in climate might be an interesting experiment		If you don’t care about humans and other things with us here, making a big change in climate might be an interesting experiment.		2

what is best for humanity		I just happen to have a personal bias (shared, I believe, by the majority of the six-plus billion people on the planet) that we should ask what is best for humanity, and pursue that.		3

that the GISP2 record is quite good and reproducible		With the other Greenland ice cores (which demonstrate that the GISP2 record is quite good and reproducible), and compared to additional records from elsewhere, an immense amount.		2

that it can not have been very important		No major changes are found in space dust, which remains rare enough that it cannot have been very important.		3
